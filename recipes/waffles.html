<strong>Ingredients:</strong></font> 

<table cellpadding="10">
<tr colspan="2">
<td>1 stick of butter<br>
4 eggs, at room temperature<br>
1 and 1/2 cups of milk<br>
1 package of yeast<br>
</td>
<td>1 pinch of salt<br>
1 tbsp sugar<br>
2 tsp vanilla extract<br>
2 cups flour</td>

<hr>
<p><font face="arial, verdana, helvetica"><strong>Warm milk (not
too hot to touch) then dissolve yeast into it. Stir until
completely dissolved.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="arial, verdana, helvetica"><strong>Separate egg
yolks and whites; set whites aside.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="arial, verdana, helvetica"><strong>To the warm
milk/yeast mixture, add egg yolks, sugar, vanilla and salt, then
mix well.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="arial, verdana, helvetica"><strong>Pour mixture into
a large, warm and dry bowl.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="arial, verdana, helvetica"><strong>Add flour slowly
and mix until completely absorbed.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="arial, verdana, helvetica"><strong>Add melted butter
and mix. Make sure butter is just melted and not so hot that it
kills the yeast.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="arial, verdana, helvetica"><strong>Beat egg whites
until stiff peaks form when you lift the beater. Fold egg whites
into the batter, but don't over mix.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="arial, verdana, helvetica"><strong>Cover bowl with a
towel and let it rise until it is about double in volume (45 min to
one hour). During this time, keep the bowl warm and out of
drafts.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="arial, verdana, helvetica"><strong>Preheat your
waffle griddle to a hot-to-very hot setting. Use some spray-on
grease if needed. Don't overfill with batter since the batter will
expand when cooked.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="arial, verdana, helvetica"><strong>Serve HOT with
maple syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, whatever is your
favorite!</strong></font></p>

LaJolla, California, the mother of my graduate school buddy, Ed
Phlips. It is a genuinely Belgian recipe! From "Some Favorite
