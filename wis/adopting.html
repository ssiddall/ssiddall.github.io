<h1>This Web isn't just "The Web" anymore</h1>

<h3>by Scott E. Siddall</h3>

There are literally thousands of information processes on campus.
We take most of them for granted. Some are large in scale and
impact, such as record keeping for payroll or student grading. Some
are small scale, even personal, such as the maintenance of private
address books. Some information processes are academic (e.g.,
faculty research and publishing, management of library collections,
creation of syllabi and much more). Some processes are
administrative (e.g., fiscal systems, asset management,
investments, student information systems for grades, registration,
and housing). Some campus information processes are ephemeral, some
seasonal, and some year-round. Many are traditional if not
indispensable and interwoven with legal responsibilities (secure
student records, for example). Our institutions' information
culture is defined by the ways in which we manage and perceive
these processes. 

<p>Web technologies are rapidly changing the opportunities to
gather, organize and distribute the information on which these
processes are based. Ease of access provided by web technologies
also increases the need to evaluate information, and to teach
critical evaluative skills to our students. I am not suggesting
that we must alter our traditional information processes just
because web technologies make changes possible.</p>

<p>Indeed, there are risks, for many of these technologies are
"digital incunabula." Printed documents produced during the period
1455-1501 are termed incunabula (Latin for straps that hold a baby
in a cradle) because many lacked pagination, tables of contents,
indices and even paragraph structure. They were immature. They
lacked other "technologies" that make the book fully useful. Just
as it took decades for Gutenberg's printing inventions of 1455 to
spawn other technologies that made a truly useful text, web
technologies are evolving. Many are immature, partial solutions to
needs that are unclear. Many are simply brittle and fail to work as
advertised. Still, in the last five years it has become abundantly
clear that networked information will have dramatic effects on our
information cultures.</p>

<p>Web technologies, especially those applied to local information
(in an intranet), make it possible to separate the physical and
logical organization of information. This is key to the (as yet
largely untapped) value of the web. For instance, printed documents
kept in file folders arranged alphabetically have been effective
for years, but this process requires that we classify each document
and in doing so, specify a particular location for that document.
To retrieve a document, one must know a great deal about the filing
system. Without highly prescribed filing algorithms, one person's
logical filing scheme will effectively hide a document from others.
The same is true even of the structured databases on which current
administrative systems depend, for again, logical filing schemes
are based on key fields and the physical separation of records into
different databases.</p>

<p>Web technologies make it possible to store and retrieve
information without linking the nature of the information to a
physical location. Web technologies also make it possible to store
and retrieve both huge and small (even tiny) documents with nearly
equal ease and cost. For retrieval, web information systems use the
power of modern computing devices to do the repetitive tasks they
were meant to do, in this case, searching through local (and even
global) collections of information which we have spent far less
time preclassifying. This approach favors a new style of
management. Event-driven management needs information
"just-in-time," not "just-in-case." "Just-in-time" is an important
strength of the web. In many ways, "JIT" defines the character of
work at the end of this millennium. Intranet uses of web technology
shows great promise for meeting these needs.</p>

<p>These important aspects of web technology have more to do with
the effective management of institutional information (and our
local information culture) than with a web presence through which
we recruit new students. In this light, web tools aren't just "The
Web" anymore.</p>

<p>It is prudent to evaluate such new tools especially when they
offer substantial promise for improved service to our students, for
better informed (and effective) staff, and for
cost-containment.</p>

<p>Web technologies are perceived to be relatively inexpensive to
implement, work interchangeably on nearly all types of computers,
are surrounded by a great deal of promotion (even hype), and are
easy to use. These are precisely the criteria on which rapid
adoption of new technology depends (see "The Diffusion of
Innovations" by Everett Rodgers, and Moore's book "Crossing the
Chasm"). It is no wonder then that browsers, web servers, personal
web pages and e-commerce have become ubiquitous, and useful, so
quickly.</p>

<p>For many of the same reasons, deploying web technologies is
quite different from the deployment of traditional software
applications. An easy-to-use application that can be downloaded at
no cost will be used by employees and students if they feel it has
value to their work. Issues of support and integration into the
information systems of the campus are not likely to be addressed.
Vendors of freeware/shareware can't provide consistent support for
the freely downloaded programs. Many firms are bankrupted as fast
as they formed. They certainly can't help customers take into
consideration their institution's decision-making processes,
organizational structure or information flow.</p>

<p>On the other hand, traditional software applications can be very
costly and so demand the attention of senior administrators who
must fund the purchase and implementation of these expensive (six
figures or more) systems. These expenses call for serious planning.
Issues of the integrity, distribution and security of institutional
information managed by expensive software will be carefully
considered during the planning and deployment phases of these large
projects. Vendors sell costly annual maintenance contracts for such
systems. They sell contracts to install programs, convert data and
train staff. They specialize in selected markets and can advise
customers about the institutional ramifications of the use of their
information systems.</p>

<p>Thus we are challenged to maintain the integrity of
institutional information processes (quality of data, appropriate
access, legal uses) in the face web-based information tools to
which every employee and student has open access. Moreover, the
information culture of our organization is challenged because these
web tools allow us to connect, relate and extract new knowledge
from heretofore unrelated repositories of information. Again, I am
not suggesting that we must alter our traditional information
processes just because web technologies make changes possible, but
if new web tools enable the campus community to extract new value
from institutional data in ways that enhance our work, then these
changes in our information processes and culture are
inevitable.</p>

<p>There are three general phases in the adoption of web
technologies (revised from Nambisan and Wang, 1999, Communications
of the ACM 42(1)):</p>

<ul>
<li>Information access</li>

<li>Collaboration and work flow</li>

<li>Curricular applications</li>
</ul>

When the web is used to disseminate information on or off campus,
the web is being used at the most fundamental level, that of
information access. When web technology is used to facilitate our
administrative work on campus, then the web is being used at the
second level. Curricular uses of the web make the web part of our
fundamental activities of teaching and learning. While corporate
America has tended to move sequentially through these stages, from
information access to collaboration to core business activity,
higher education, especially colleges with a fundamental teaching
mission, seem to have followed a slightly different course.
Web-based library catalogs and databases, for example were followed
quickly by web-based syllabi and then collaborative web projects as
constructivist approaches to learning. Collaboration in the
classroom has benefited from web technologies since the mid-1990s
(see Siddall and Sacks, "<a href=
"../talks/cause97/index.htm">Intense, Intimate &amp; Informed</a>"
and Badrul H. Khan's book, "Web-Based Instruction"). At the same
time, our institutional administrative systems are only beginning
to plan for easy-to-use, ubiquitous web interfaces (see the
Gettysburg College's "<a href="webdemo/cnav.html">Campus
Navigator</a>" or SCT Corporation's <a href=
"webdemo/employee/emp_main.htm">demonstrations of web
interfaces</a>), or Blackboard's <a href=
"http://www.blackboard.com/">Course Management System</a>for management of course materials. 

<p>The sequence of web adoption is less important than creating a
coordinated approach to these rapid changes. Who is keeping track
of new developments in web technology? Who is systematically
evaluating new information management tools? Who is tracking the
myriad and unsettled legal issues that are woven into nearly all
these new web tools? And what about policies for information
quality and their enforcement? At many campuses and corporations,
these are duties of the "webmaster" which is more often a team than
an individual, even in small institutions.</p>

<p>Most small college campuses have established a committee to
advise senior staff on these and related issues. Many of the
functions of the traditional webmaster are not part of the charter
of these web advisory committees. To understand these planning,
implementation and advisory roles, I'll review the chronology of
the last eight to ten years.</p>

<p>In the early '90s, webmasters set up and managed web servers
that presented public information to the early surfers of the
Internet. New staff positions were not created for these roles.
Existing job descriptions were expanded to include web server
management. Indeed the role was not extremely taxing as long as
someone on campus wrote the web pages that were served. Therefore
at this point, we have two rather different functions &ndash; web
server management and content preparation. Throughout the mid-'90s,
college staff trained many information providers (who converted
existing documents or wrote new documents in HTML format). This
training function became an important element in colleges' use of
web technology. For the most part, web training was simply added to
the offerings of campus technology training efforts. Classes in
HTML publishing remain popular although online, web-based training
materials and easy-to-use authoring programs are also popular.</p>

<p>Many of these page maintainers worked on web pages outside of
the definition of their job duties. In some cases, they were
preparing materials for presentation that required their
supervisors' permission to "publish" on the web. At this point,
then, many colleges defined another function related to the web
&ndash; that of information sponsor - the person whose
responsibility it is to approve the posting of new types of
information on web pages.</p>

<p>Many web pages provide means for outsiders to fill in forms to
submit information. These sources of contact with outsiders require
staff attention. Requests for a printed viewbook must be forwarded
to admissions; inquiries about updating an alumni address must get
to alumni affairs. These aspects of contact management must be
handled promptly and without loss of information if the reputation
of the institution's web presence is to remain solid.</p>

<p>So now we have several broad sets of activities &ndash; web
server management, web training, content sponsorship, content
formatting, and contact management.</p>

<p>As more and more members of our campus communities began to
publish web pages, web training and consulting consumed more and
more staff time. This increase in attribution of staff resources to
web projects quickly became clear. Few colleges had planned for
additional staff time needed to take full advantage of the new web
medium. This was probably a prudent course of action at the time
because the web was not a proven mode of communication. By the
beginning of the new century, the strategic value of web
technologies for creating an informative public presentation was
confirmed.</p>

<p>Most small college campuses have created new positions for
managing the institutional home page. The campus home page is often
viewed as a new form of official publication. At some institutions,
the campus web site is perceived as exclusively as a means of
communication with the public. Editorial responsibility rests with
the public relations departments; technical support is provided by
the information technology departments. However, web technologies
provide significant strategic value in ways beyond that of public
presentation. The coordinated management of web technologies for on
campus applications (Intranet uses, as opposed to external Internet
uses) has become the focus of leading academic institutions of all
sizes and missions.</p>

<p>Network and web technologies continue to empower more people to
publish their own materials. At many campuses, staff at all levels
are maintaining web pages if not also running their own personal or
departmental web servers on their office computer. Many students
are running personal web servers from personal computers connected
to the residence hall network. Web-oriented products such as <a
href=
"http://www.microsoft.com/office/2000/Office/Brochure/default.htm">
Microsoft Office 2000</a>, which is used at many colleges, is
fueling these trends. All of these activities are increasing the
need for staff to devote time to monitoring, advising, training for
and coordinating web services.</p>

<p>Thus, web management includes at least five main areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>web server management</li>

<li>training and consulting services</li>

<li>content management</li>

<li>web site contact management</li>

<li>policy management</li>
</ul>

<h3>Some recommendations</h3>

There are many pathways to success; here are a few. 

<p>Server management is a highly technical activity. Included are
web server installation and routine maintenance (backup, upgrades,
etc), traffic monitoring and capacity planning. Server management
is best conducted by highly-trained technology staff. Some aspects
of the campus web infrastructure can profitably be outsourced for
purposes of reliability, performance and total cost. Please read
"<a href=
"http://siddall.info/talks/outsource/index.htm">Outsourcing
the Campus Web</a>" for more detail on this concept.</p>

<p>Training and consulting are often combined into a single staff
function. Training includes more than the offering of scheduled or
departmental training sessions; it includes a relatively large
commitment to document development and especially to individual
consulting. Consulting with web publishers consumes large number of
staff hours and ranges from coordinating related site work,
one-on-one training, research and development to meet specific as
well as future needs, and in some cases, production work where
institutional needs call for it.</p>

<p>Consulting is particularly important for non-technical staff who
wish to take full advantage of the web as a new medium. For
traditional textual content, standard web technologies are
adequate, and modern web authoring tools can meet the web
publishers' needs. For more advanced uses, there is a strong
interdependence between content and the latest technology used to
present the content. What one says on new web pages depends upon
what technology one uses, and for non-technical staff, this
emphasizes the need for consultation from staff who are abreast of
the latest developments. Web technologies should be seen more as
opportunities with cost and less as obstacles.</p>

<p>Routine content management is best moved "out" to the
departments who sponsor information. Web sites are often less
successful when departmental information is routinely mediated by
non-departmental staff. It is important that the overall public web
presentation has a clear "look and feel" to meet the identity needs
of the institution, while at the same time ensuring that those who
know the departmental business are at the front line of content
presentation. This does not suggest that "official" college web
pages should not be managed centrally by public relations. The
purpose of official pages parallels that of traditional print
publications which has always been centrally managed by public
affairs staff. Central management of official college web
presentations requires significant staff resources.</p>

<p>Management of general web contacts includes responding to
inquiries and parsing the hundreds of general information requests
received through the visitors' center or prospective student
requests (e.g., sent to webmaster@domain.edu, or entered into the
guestbook). Some of these interactions with the public through the
web will shift to departmental pages and will be managed there, yet
some will remain embedded in the official pages of the college.
These general contacts should be managed by public affairs staff to
ensure that the college web site is accurately responsive to public
inquiry.</p>

<p>Policy management - a huge topic in itself - is usually handled
best by a consultative body that is authorized by the campus
leadership to represent all constituencies in creating, maintaining
and enforcing policies. As the impact of web technologies grows,
however, it should be recognized that this advisory body is likely
to be called upon for advice on technological possibilities and
their impact on the campus information culture. These are issues
concerning people and culture far more than issues of
technology.</p>

<h3>It's all "Digital Incunabula"</h3>

New tools for web creation and management are constantly evolving.
Some of these will alter the ways in which the college distributes
responsibilities for web management. For example, programs allow
busy college staff working on the front lines of their field
(athletics, health and counseling, special events coordinators) to
update specific components on selected web pages without
substantial training. These programs (Java scripts) make daily if
not hourly updating of web content possible with no knowledge of
HTML, file transfers, etc. These and related tools make it possible
for public affairs staffs to coordinate centrally the overall web
presentation while decentralizing content management in ways that
ensure an accurate, timely and interactive presentation. 

<p>The key to much of web management is knowing what is best done
centrally and what is best done at the front lines of college
business. However we manage it, the web isn't just "The Web"
anymore.</p>
