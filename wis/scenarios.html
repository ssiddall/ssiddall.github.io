<h1>Issues, Audiences, Conflicts</h1>

<p>The details of each scenario are presented as a conflict (of
opinion, need, policy, <em>etc</em>) within a broadly defined area
of issues concerning design, access and quality of information.
Each scenario has a target audience (on- or off-campus, alums,
parents, prospective students, supporters of the college, <em>
etc</em>).</p>

<p><font size="+1"><strong>Design issues include, among many
topics:</strong></font></p>

<ul>
<li>the "look and feel" of a single web page or the entire web
site</li>

<li>the presence or absence of navigational buttons ("back" and
"home" buttons that might be part of the page itself), disclaimers
or clear statements of authorship&gt;</li>

<li>the relative placement of images or text on a page that imply
relationships among entities (such as inappropriate
hierarchies)</li>

<li>design elements which "break" when viewed by other
browsers</li>
</ul>

<p><font size="+1"><strong>Access issues
include:</strong></font></p>

<ul>
<li>authenticating someone prior to their access to data</li>

<li>authenticating changes in data submitted through web
technology</li>

<li>rights to privacy for personal, departmental, collegial
information</li>

<li>monitoring and recording individuals' access to
information</li>

<li>distributed responsibility for information, the need to mediate
others' information access or the need to elminate information
middlemen</li>
</ul>

<p><font size="+1"><strong>Quality of information
includes:</strong></font></p>

<ul>
<li>accuracy and timeliness of data</li>

<li>respect for intellectual property rights</li>

<li>free-speech, censorship concerns, editorial responsibility</li>

<li>for-profit uses</li>

<li>official college pages versus departmental pages versus
personal pages</li>
</ul>

<h1>Management activity</h1>

Management of web policies is related to all three of these areas
of concern. The management and enforcement of policies for the web
require resources - people, software, hardware. There are always
dangers of, for example, endorsing policies that require college
staff to mediate processes on behalf of others, or to proactively
monitor web uses for problems. The attribution of staff time can be
significant in light of rapidly increasing demands for access to
the opportunities afforded by the web. Automated systems can assist
in web management, including the enforcement of policies, but such
systems (software and hardware) can be prohibitively expensive. 

<p>The design and initial development of a web site is the first
step in a continuing activity of web maintenance. Static web sites
rarely sustain visitor interest. Web sites almost always need
routine updating because the most useful information has a short
half-life. In this way, web systems bear little resemblance to
traditional software development projects in which programs were
written, tested, marketed and supported. Effective web information
systems expand and contract in coverage, change content,
incorporate new technologies and evolve rapidly.</p>
