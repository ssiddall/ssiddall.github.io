<h1 align="CENTER">Where are all the geology majors?</h1>

Spacious, new science buildings at Kenyon had transformed the
teaching of science at the College. The natural sciences were
experiencing something akin to a renaissance in interest. As a
result of enrollment trends, the geology department has been able
to hire two new assistant professors. Both new members of the
faculty had a track record for excellence in teaching, often with
innovative technologies. 

<p>Soon after arriving, Professor Bill Stone set up a web server on
his office desktop system. Bill brought along all of his class
materials as web pages and his early successes in this new medium
impressed his departmental colleagues. When it came time to review
the departmental web page, which had been the same since 1946, it
was Bill who stepped forward to lead this redesign effort.</p>

<p>After working sporadically on the project through the month of
July, Bill announced that he and his student, Jack, had completed a
highly interactive web site for the Department of Geology. The
buttons and framed pages of the site were designed to coordinate
with the color of the natural rock backgrounds Sam scanned from the
GEOL 3 textbook. There were several pages of images of faculty,
faculty research projects and field trips, links to other sites of
interest to the department, several interactive forms to gather
information about visitors to the site, animated banners with news
about courses (written in Javascript) and a departmental calendar
with news for each week. Anyone who revisits the site is welcomed
back, a crafty personal touch. The department was thrilled with the
result!</p>

<p>Bill had the LBIS staff set up an alias for his computer, which
was named K19845 but with the alias could be found as
geology.kenyon.edu. He asked the webmaster to have the official
College web page for the department point to the new departmental
page. He was in business!</p>

<p>Two years later, after Bill found out just how much time is
consumed in teaching at Kenyon, the registrar published summary
statistics about student interests. There had been a very
significant decline in the interest of new students in geology.
There had been a decline as well in the number of new majors. These
were disturbing trends deserving of investigation. The registrar,
dean of admissions and the chair of the science division gathered
some of the students to learn that:</p>

<p>The geology departmental web page was always out of date. No one
seem to have maintained it. None of the calendar entries were
current. Some were two years out of date!</p>

<p>The link to the departmental pages was often "broken" since it
seemed that the web server it was running on was often turned off
at nights and on weekends.</p>

<p>Some students dismissed geology at Kenyon since the web page
they saw at home with their old web browser software was garbled at
best, and often blank and took nearly 3 minutes to download. "I can
only assume that the geologists aren't very careful folks" said one
first year student. "The Department of Geology at Kenyon? I didn't
know they had one....this site looked so different from the rest of
the Kenyon web site."</p>

<p>"I filled out one of those online forms at the geology web site,
but no one ever responded to me. I asked about the major, but heard
nothing."</p>

<p>Some students complained about the use of cookies, a technology
that made it possible for the geology web site to welcome returning
visitors. "I don't like it when a web site writes a file to my hard
drive without my permission! How do I know what's going on?" Jack
had incorporated this technology into the departmental web site
without Bill knowing about it.</p>

<p>Several prospective geology majors reported that their interest
in the discipline waned when they did reach the web page only to
find that its emphasis was on faculty research, not teaching. One
student said "This web page made it clear what this department is
all about, and it's not working with students." This of course
puzzled the division chairperson who noted the strong track record
the department had in popular classes and research involving
students.</p>

<p>When confronted with these issues, Bill Stone, who was fast
approaching his second year reappointment review, lamented the
situation but declared that he simply had too little time to keep
up the web site.</p>
