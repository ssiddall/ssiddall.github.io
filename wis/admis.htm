<h1 align="CENTER">The missing class of 2010</h1>

<p>The Kenyon College web site had been bringing visitors to the
campus, virtually, for more than five years now. The log files
which track the locations from where visitors come are indicating
that 2,000 people each day see the Kenyon web pages, and many of
these, on the order of hundreds each day, are prospective students
and prospective parents. Mailings of the traditional "Did You Know"
postcards featuring the web site have augmented attendance at the
site. With the numbers building each year, there seems little need
to revamp such a successful web presence.</p>

<p>While Kenyon was enjoying the benefits of this status quo,
several start-up firms on the Internet began to force what some
called the most significant changes in admissions procedures
nationwide. One such firm, Colleges-R-Us, is a case in point.</p>

<p>Colleges-R-Us has assembled an enormous web site of information
about residential colleges. Some of the featured insitutions focus
on the liberal arts but many have other programs in engineering,
pre-nursing and business. Some of the institutions showcased at
Colleges-R-Us are small colleges like Kenyon. Colleges-R-Us started
operations by showcasing 100 colleges of diverse ranking. No fee
was charged these schools. Kenyon was not one of them. Kenyon
elected to participate in other similar programs but not
Colleges-R-Us. The fees were relatively high and the commercial
advertisements that were apparently associated with Colleges-R-Us
were deemed inappropriate. Case closed - no one at Kenyon monitored
the fortunes of Colleges-R-Us.</p>

<p>The business model for Colleges-R-Us is simple: in return for a
fee from participating colleges and commercial advertisers,
Colleges-R-Us attracts prospective students and assists them with
their application process. Technically, Colleges-R-Us has lifted
most of their information from the web sites of the participating
colleges, or links to the college's web site. Little new
information is provided by Colleges-R-Us. Colleges-R-Us ran ads in
print media, TV spots, and did everything possible to capture the
searches of any prospective college student surfing the 'Net.</p>

<p>Colleges-R-Us became the market leader almost overnight,
attracting nearly 200,000 prospective students through its virtual
doors in a single year. Kenyon was not a beneficiary of this
growth. Instead, applications to Kenyon declined 20% that year,
forcing a number of adjustments in the admissions process which
ultimately were reflected in the statistics on which college
rankings are based. What will happen next year?</p>
