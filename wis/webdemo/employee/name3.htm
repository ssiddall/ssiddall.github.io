Name Change Information</h2>

<h4>You have asked to change your name in the University's Human
Resources System. To ensure proper tax reporting, federal
regulations require employers to validate that the employee's
name on record exactly matches the name which appears on the
individual's social security card. Thus, in order to reflect your
name change on your personnel and payroll records, you must
present your social security card which reflects your new name to
the Payroll Office in Room 212 of the Central Administration
Building.</h4>

<h4>If you have not yet requested a change of name with the
Social Security Administration, please apply for a new social
security card with the nearest Social Security Administration
Office. (Note: You will need to bring an original legal document
reflecting your new name to support your request for the name
change. Examples of accepted legal documents include a birth
certificate, marriage license, divorce decree, etc.) Once you
receive your new social security card, please bring it to the
Payroll Office in Room 212 of the Central Administration
Building. Please call 412-456-9082 if you have questions or
concerns. </h4>
