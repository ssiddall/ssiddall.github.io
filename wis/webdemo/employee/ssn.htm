Social Security Number Change Information</h2>

<hr>

<h4>You have asked to change your social security number in the
University's Human Resources System. To ensure proper tax
reporting, federal regulations require employers to validate that
each employee's social security number and name on the employer's
records exactly matches the name which appears on the
individual's social security card. Thus, in order to change
either your social security number or your name in your personnel
and payroll records, you must present your social security card
which reflects the correct social security number to the Payroll
Office in Room 212 of the Central Administration Building. Please
call 412-456-9082 if you have questions or concerns. </h4>
