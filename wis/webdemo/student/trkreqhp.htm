<h1>Tracking Requirements Help</h1>

<hr>

<p>Depending upon the type of financial aid, a standard set of
application requirements may be required of you before you can
obtain the aid you are qualified to receive. For example, if you
are scheduled to receive a Stafford Loan, a requirement of the
loan program mandates that you meet with a financial aid
administrator to review the terms of the loan before the loan is
applied to your account. Outstanding obligations such as this are
listed under the Unsatisfied Requirements heading. The Satisfied
Requirements section lists those tracking requirements that you
have already fulfilled. </p>

<p>The Tracking Messages link allows you to review any messages
pertaining to these application requirements. These messages
should provide you with more detail on how to satisfy the
existing requirements. The Additional Requirements link displays
those requirements that are specific to a term, rather than the
entire year; it may also list those requirements that are not
part of a standard educational aid program. </p>
