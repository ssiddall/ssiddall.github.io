<h1>Applicant/Student Financial Aid Access Menu Help</h1>

<hr>

<p>If you would like to review the status of your financial aid
package, select one of the Financial Aid Information Request
options. The Overall Status of Financial Aid option allows you to
review the status of your financial aid application, tracking
requirements, budgeted cost of attendance, financial award
package, other resources, academic history, satisfactory academic
progress, financial aid holds, short term credit, credits to your
student account, financial aid history, and any defaults on
loans. Other Financial Aid Information Request options include
financial aid history, tracking requirements, other resources,
current award package, short term credit, applicant messages and
a means to respond to these messages, student employment,
financial aid payments, and the ability to draft an electronic
mail message.</p>

<p>Since all of these statuses are determined by a defined aid
year, you can change this parameter to match your needs with the
Select Parameters option.</p>
