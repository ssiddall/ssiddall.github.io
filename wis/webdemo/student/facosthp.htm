<h1>Financial Aid Estimated Cost of Attendance Help</h1>

<hr>

<p>The cost of attendance is the total amount it should cost you
to go to school. This amount includes tuition, room and board,
fees, books and supplies, transportation, and personal expenses.
These costs are affected by the financial aid year and budget
period (full academic year, fall semester, spring semester,
summer semester, etc.) in which you are enrolled. Other factors
such as whether you are an undergraduate or graduate student,
reside on or off-campus, or are a state resident or non-resident,
determine your budget group classification.</p>

<p>Select an aid year, budget period, and budget characteristic
from the appropriate pull-down lists, and press the Estimate
button. An estimate of your Cost of Attendance displays based on
these selections. </p>
