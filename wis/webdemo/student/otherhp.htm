<h1>Other Resources Help</h1>

<hr>

<p>Other resources are funds that are available to you from
sources other than the federal government, state government, or
the school you are currently attending. Other resources reduce
the amount of your financial need - the difference between the
cost of attending school and your ability to pay these costs.
Outside scholarships, prepaid tuition plans, and GI benefits are
examples of other resources. </p>

<p>The financial aid office uses the estimated resource amounts
until actual funds are received from the resource. The actual
resource amounts display when the funds are received from the
resource and applied to your student account. </p>
