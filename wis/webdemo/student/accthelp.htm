<h1>Account Summary Help</h1>

<hr>

<p>The account summary enables you to review summarized charge
and payment information for your account. The account information
is ordered by term and itemizes each account category and its
summarized balance. The term balance is calculated by adding the
term charges and term credits/payments for the term. The
cumulative account balance, which is the total of all term
balances, displays at the bottom of the page. </p>
