<h1>Short Term Credit Help</h1>

<hr>

<p>Short term loans are sometimes used to provide you with
sufficient funds to handle emergency situations. You do not have
to receive financial aid in order to receive short term credit.
However, if you do receive financial aid, your unmet need or
other financial data has no effect on your eligibility for short
term credit. </p>

<p>The Account field identifies the funding source of the loan.
You can have more than one loan from the same account or from
different accounts. </p>
