<h1>Financial Aid Holds Help</h1>

<hr>

<p>A hold may exist on your account to indicate that an action is
required by you as soon as possible. For example, a financial aid
hold may be placed on your account because you failed to submit
your parents' W-2 form for income verification. This page alerts
you to the Financial Aid holds that exist on your account. You
can view Student holds if you select the Student Holds link. </p>
