<h1>Student Budget Help</h1>

<hr>

<p>Your student budget is calculated based on the financial aid
year, the budget group (students with similar budgeting
characteristics), and the aid period (full academic year, fall
semester, etc.). The student budget is a representation of these
cost groupings and provides you with an estimate of the expenses
you will most likely encounter during the given period. </p>
