<h3>Grant Information</h3>

<p><a name="sct"></a> <b>SCT Grant</b><br>
This institutional grant is provided to students who demonstrate
financial need. </p>

<p><a name="pell"></a> <b>Federal Pell Grant Program</b><br>
A Federal Pell Grant, unlike a loan, does not have to be repaid.
Pell Grants are awarded only to undergraduate students who have
not earned a bachelor's or professional degree. For many
students, Pell Grants provide a foundation of financial aid to
which other aid may be added. </p>

<p><a name="supplemental"></a> <b>Federal Supplemental
Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)</b><br>
This grant is for undergraduates with exceptional financial need,
and gives priority to students who receive Federal Pell Grants.
You do not have to repay an FSEOG. </p>

<p><a name="tuition"></a> <b>Tuition Assistance Grant</b><br>
This state grant is provided to students who demonstrate
financial need. </p>

<h3>Loan Information</h3>

<p><a name="federal stafford"></a> <b>Federal Stafford Loans</b><br>
(Federal Direct Loans &amp; Federal Family Educational Loans)<br>
Federal Stafford Loans (Stafford Loans) are the Department's
major form of self-help aid and are available through the William
D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program and the Federal
Family Educational Loan (FFEL) Program. The terms and conditions
of a Direct Stafford or an FFEL Stafford are similar. The major
differences between the two are the source of the loan funds,
some aspects of the application process, and the available
repayment plans. Under this program, the funds for your Stafford
Loan come to you directly from the U.S. government. If your
school does not participate in Direct Loans, the funds for your
Stafford Loan will come to you from a bank, credit union, or
other lender that participates in the FFEL Program. </p>

<p>The Direct and FFEL programs also offer PLUS Loans for parents
of dependent students and Consolidation Loans. </p>

<p>Stafford Loans are either subsidized or unsubsidized. A
subsidized loan is awarded on the basis of financial need. The
federal government pays interest on the loan
(&quot;subsidizes&quot; the loan) until you begin repayment and
during authorized periods of deferment. An unsubsidized loan is
not awarded on the basis of need. You'll be charged interest from
the time the loan is disbursed until it is paid in full. </p>

<p><a name="perkins"></a> <b>Federal Perkins Loan Program (PERK)</b><br>
A Federal Perkins Loan is a low-interest (5 percent) loan for
both undergraduate and graduate students with exceptional
financial need. Your school is your lender and the loan is made
with government funds. You must repay this loan to your school.</p>
