<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>I've created these pages as a means to stimulate thinking about
the broadest possible implications of web technology on campus,
because "The Web" is not just about recruiting new students, or
keeping up a public image of the institution. Web technologies are
evolving and are being adopted rapidly in light of their relatively
low cost, accessibility and ease of use. Some offer the promise of
transforming long-standing information processes to improve
service, collaboration and even learning.</p>

<h2>Adopting web technologies</h2>

"<a href="adopting.html">This Web isn't just "The Web" anymore</a>"
is a short essay on the processes involved in engaging profitably
with this new medium. 

<h2>Principles for a campus-wide web initiative</h2>

A <a href="http://www.denison.edu/irab/vision.shtml">draft list of
principles</a> to spark conversation about how we use web
technologies to manage information across all campus boundaries. 

<h2>Web Information Systems</h2>

Some concepts of modern Web Information Systems were presented to
the <a href="http://siddall.info/talks/irab/index.html">
Denison University Information Resources Advisory Board</a> and at
the <a href="http://siddall.info/talks/wis/index.htm">Kenyon
College Senior Staff retreat</a>. 

<h2>Web Scenarios</h2>

Several "<a href="scenarios.html">Web Scenarios</a>" are presented
as a way to introduce many of the complex interdependencies we face
in web system design and management. One might interpret each
scenario in light of his or her own areas of responsibility or
concern. All names are fictitious but several of the scenarios are
based on real situations encountered at Kenyon in the last two
years.<br>

about web sites here and anywhere.
