<h1 align="CENTER">They said WHAT??</h1>

<p>Professor John Hoopla is one of the most successful teachers at
Kenyon, having taught political science for nearly two decades "On
the Hill." His students and his colleagues respect his teaching and
scholarship; many of his students have graduated to fill positions
of great responsibility. John is liberal-minded and enjoys having
his students probe challenging issues independently, in depth. For
the past decade, John has required his students in "American
Political Tradition" to write 10-12 page term papers in which they
devise and analyze a political situation. This has been a tough but
popular assignment which, in 1997, became even more popular with
the students when John decided that the final papers would be
presented to his department on the web.</p>

<p>John's course attracts many first year students, some of which
were excited about the opportunity to demonstrate their skills in
web publishing, and some of which were anxious about the imminent
experience. While the class generally had not yet had time to
understand the campus culture in this first semester, they took to
the assignment with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>In November, as John gathered first drafts of the papers (there
were 23 students in the class!), he could tell that he had some
firebrands in the group. Some of the drafts showed great analytic
and writing skills, while others were borderline for taste if not
content. One such marginal draft, from Will, imagined that an
unnamed mayor of a small town had been accused of fiscal
misconduct. Professor Hoopla encouraged Will to be cautious about
his handling of the subject, for ultimately, the department would
read Will's final draft. Will was not the most compliant student;
he had rebuked authority more than once already in this, his first
semester. But Will took Prof. Hoopla's advice, for now.</p>

<p>All 23 papers were installed on the campus web server in time
for the departmental presentations. No one beyond the department
faculty and majors were present, and in fact, very few knew about
the presentations. All went smoothly, including Will's
presentation. At least, all went well that day.</p>

<p>During the semester break, while students and faculty alike were
enjoying some deserved quiet time, Thomas Hearty, mayor of suburban
Midlake, Ohio, was surfing the 'Net. He started at the Kenyon web
site, his alma mater. As a trustee of the College, he remained a
strong moral and financial supporter of the College. He searched
for his name on the site and failed to find it, but when he
searched for the term "mayor" he found a dozen pages, many of which
mentioned his work on behalf of the College. The top-most page,
however, was titled "Mayor Hardly responds to charges of
impropriety," and drew his immediate attention. While Will's term
paper was not announced, and had no direct web links from the
Kenyon web pages to it, the mayor had found it. Despite the simple
change in the spelling of the mayor's last name, Will's scenario
clearly connected this fictitious political scandal to the real
mayor and trustee of the College. While nothing slanderous was
said, much of the web site was in poor taste when read outside of
the context of the course (in which it earned Will a B-). Clearly,
while Prof. Hoopla had intended for only his department to read
these papers, others, even those off-campus, could find the papers
with keyword searches.</p>

<p>Mayor Hearty phones the president who tells the webmaster to
remove the paper from the web server. Now there are 22 papers on
the web from Prof. Hoopla's American Political Tradition.</p>

<p>On January 17, as Will and his roommate are preparing to
register for second semester classes, Will discovers that his
paper, and only his paper, has been removed. Deleted apparently
from the web server. Will's instinct is to challenge immediately
the authority who has selected out his paper, and with thoughts of
a legal battle over censorship.</p>

<p>After a moment to reflect, Will decides simply that he will
repost his paper on the computer he owns, the one connected to the
campus Internet domain through his SNAP+ network connection. He
kept an electronic copy of the lastest version anyway. Within 30
minutes, Will's political scenario about "Mayor Hardly" was back on
the 'Net, and accessible to anyone on the Internet. He contemplated
spending 5 minutes to register his paper with the SubmitIT!
service. SubmitIT! would make sure the paper was indexed in the top
50 search engines like Yahoo and AltaVista. He wasn't that proud of
the paper so instead he inserted a few "meta tags" in the title -
keywords that would surely attract attention to his experience with
what he felt was censorship.</p>

<p>What happens next?</p>
