<HR ALIGN=CENTER>
<P>Microsoft PowerPoint is a multimedia presentation program for creating overhead transparencies, 35mm slides, and on-screen electronic presentations.  In addition to your presentation you can create and print &quot;Notes Pages,&quot; which contain scripts for each slide and serve as your notes during your presentation, print an outline of your presentation, and print hand-outs of each slide for your audience.</P>
<P>Creating a presentation is simplified with the aid of &#147;Wizards&#148; and templates which help you get started with the basic design of your presentation.  Wizards guide you in developing your idea and designing your presentation.  Templates apply a predesigned color scheme and text layout to your slides.</P>
<H2><A ID="I2" NAME="I2">
<BR>To Get Started</A></H2>
<HR ALIGN=CENTER>
<P>After starting PowerPoint you have the choice of either creating a new presentation or opening an existing presentation.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="mg17.gif" WIDTH = 396 HEIGHT = 282 ALT="Undisplayed Graphic"></CENTER></P>
<P>There are four choices for creating a new presentation.  The choice you choose depends on how much and what type of guidance you require in getting started.  </P>
<P>AutoContent Wizard -guides you in determining the content and organization of  the presentation.</P>
<P>Pick a Look Wizard - guides you in determining the look (design) of the presentation.</P>
<P>Template -guides you in determining the color scheme, text layout, and other design features of the presentation.</P>
<P> Blank Presentation -allows you to begin developing your presentation with a predefined color scheme and text layout design.</P>
<P>The first time user should choose the AutoContent Wizard to get started.  The AutoContent Wizard will guide you through creating your title slide and choosing what type of presentation you want to create by selecting a presentation category.  Depending on the category you choose an outline will be generated with predefined titles and text.  The predefined titles and text serve to guide you in organizing your presentation and can be replaced with your own titles and text.  </P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="mg18.gif" WIDTH = 396 HEIGHT = 309 ALT="Undisplayed Graphic"></P>
<P>Presentations can be developed in one of any four &quot;views&quot;.  Each view shows one or more slides in a unique style for editing and organizing your presentation. Within each view you  can add special effects which enhance the transition from one slide to the next and spell check your text.   The different views are provided to enable you to work with your electronic presentation in much the same way you would with actual 35mm slides or transparencies.</P>
<P>The most often used view is the outline view.  The outline view provides a view of the title and text of each slide.  Slides can be moved and resorted by clicking on the corresponding slide icon and dragging it to it's new position.  The text font and size can be easily changed for one slide or a group of slides at one time by clicking and dragging the mouse over the text to be modified and then choosing the new font and/or size.  New slides can be inserted at any point. Slide titles can be easily converted to subtitles by pressing the Tab key after selecting the intended text.  Likewise, subtitles can be quickly converted to titles by pressing Shift-Tab after selecting the intended text.  Outlines can be exported to WordPerfect, and likewise, a WordPerfect outline can be imported to PowerPoint.  Thisallows course syllabus text created in WordPerfect to be brought into PowerPoint, sorted and organized for a presentation.</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="mg19.gif" WIDTH = 396 HEIGHT = 285 ALT="Undisplayed Graphic">Outline View</P>
<P>The Slide View allows you to work on one slide at a time.  You can type text, change the layout, draw shapes, and import graphics from other programs.</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="mg20.gif" WIDTH = 396 HEIGHT = 285 ALT="Undisplayed Graphic">Slide View</P>
<P>Slide Sorter view allows you to see more than one slide at a time in miniature scale.  The slide sorter view allows you to get a bettersense of how your slides flow and reorder them as necessary.  In addition, the slide sorter view allows you to practice and time your presentation so that you can be sure to complete your presentation within a predetermined time limit.</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="mg21.gif" WIDTH = 396 HEIGHT = 285 ALT="Undisplayed Graphic">Slide Sorter View</P>
<P>In the Notes Pages view you can create notes for use during your presentation which will accompany each slide.  These pages are printed out and referenced to keep your presentation on track.  The Notes Pages may contain drawings as well as text just like slides.</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="mg22.gif" WIDTH = 396 HEIGHT = 285 ALT="Undisplayed Graphic">Notes Pages View</P>
<P>A fifth view, Slide Show view, allows you to see your finished slide but does not allow you to edit it.  You must be in one of the other four views to edit your slide.  The Slide Show view allows you to see your presentation as an electronic slide show.  You will be able to see the effects of any transitions and timing you've incorporated into your slides.</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="mg23.gif" WIDTH = 396 HEIGHT = 285 ALT="Undisplayed Graphic">Slide Show View</P>
<P>You can freely move from one view to the other without disrupting any of your work.  Simply click on the corresponding view icon at the bottom of the PowerPoint window.</P>

If you wish to limit the list of files to only those of the format you are interested in you will need to click on the &quot;List Files of Type:&quot; listbox and select the file format you want.  Use the corresponding controls in the Insert Picture dialog box to find the file you want to insert. Once you've found it you can click on the file name in the &quot;File Name:&quot; listbox and then click on K  . </P>
<P>The image will be inserted  in your slide.  You can simply click and hold the left mouse button while pointing at the image and then drag the mouse to position the image where you want it.</P>

<P>Inserting a sound or video into a slide is similar to inserting images, except sound and video is accessed through a different menu option. Select the INSERT | OBJECT menu.  The Insert Object dialog box will appear.  There are two methods for inserting a sound or video object.  You can either &quot;Create New&quot; which will startup the appropriate application for creating the type of object you've selected, or you can &quot;Create from File&quot; which will allow you to insert a sound or video file that has already been created.  </P>
<P>If the object you want to insert has not been created yet then click on the &quot;Create New&quot; radio button.  Select the type of object you want to create from the &quot;Object Type:&quot; listbox and then click on K  .  The corresponding application for creating the chosen type of object will be launched.

<BR>To Present Your Slides</A></H2>
<HR ALIGN=CENTER>
<P>Once your electronic slides have been completed and saved to a .PPT file you can view the presentation with the PowerPoint Viewer program.  This program allows you to only run and view your presentation and does not allow you to make any changes.</P>
<P>You will need to have your presentation file (filename.PPT) and the PowerPoint Viewer program on the computer system you plan to use to present your slides.  The PowerPoint Viewer program is PPTVIEW.EXE and can be freely copied and distributed.  </P>
<P>Run PPTVIEW.EXE from Program Manager in Windows.  The PowerPooint Viewer program will prompt you for the presentation file to run.  In addition you may want to choose to have the presentation run continuously until the E key is pressed.  In order to run your presentation continuously you must either have set a specific time-delay for each slide or you must enable the automatic timing option in the PowerPoint viewer program.  Otherwise, you simply press the spacebar or right arrow keys to advance to the next slide and press the left arrow key to backup to the previous slide.</P>
