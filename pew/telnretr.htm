<P> To Connect To <A ID="I4" NAME="I4"></A>Databases Using Telnet</P>
<P>There are many valuable databases accessible on the Internet, but they are built upon a wide variety of software platforms, and require a variety of search commands. One must connect to the  computer holding the databases, access the database, and once in the database use the search language specific to it.</P>
<P>Telnet enables connection to many different types of  computers. You may be requested to enter a username and password, username alone, or in many cases be allowed directly into the  database. There usually is a Help feature (look for the navigational commands, often listed at the bottom of the screen). Consult the Help feature to learn the search commands and,  equally as important, how to exit. If the particular database  does not list an exit command try Quit, Exit, End, or Logoff.  If these do not work, be patient  almost all systems have a </P>
<P>timeout feature and automatically disconnect after a few minutes</P>
<P>of nonactivity. </P>

<P>From the VAX prompt, type</P>
<P>               $ TELNET A.CNI.ORG  R</P>
<P>When you see the prompt &quot;Username&quot; coming from the remote computer, enter in small letters only [<B><I>note:</I></B> systems based on UNIX are casesensitive  it is often important whether a small letter or large letter is required.]</P>
<P>               brsuser  R</P>
<P>You have now connected to a database maintained by the Coalition For Networked Information, using as a platform software produced by a company named BRS (hence the username brsuser).  This database maintains an archive of Internet email messages from several discussion lists that focus on Internet resources and Internet training. </P>
<P>Please read the onscreen prompts carefully. When asked your terminal type select VT100. (Kenyon users should always select the standard VAX terminal type VT100.)</P>
<P>       Please choose 1 to see the database's options.</P>
<P>Go to the second screen (press  R ) and choose NTHP for the archive of the discussion list NetHappenings.  Search the database using terms central to your interests  you may find leads to other Telnetaccessible databases, Gopher sources, or discussion lists of possible interest to you.</P>
<P>Try the same searches in the database TPND  CNI's effort at a subject index to Internet resources.</P>
