<HR ALIGN=CENTER>
<P>Government information exists in abundance on the Internet; nearly every site has a link to federal government sources.  With thousands of sites to choose from, where does one begin?  Or, more appropriately, how does one begin?</P>

<BR>Search Strategies</A></H2>
<HR ALIGN=CENTER>
<P>Most government information seekers fall into three broad--yet often overlapping--categories:  they are searching for a specific document; they are searching for information on a particular subject; or they are searching for information by a particular government agency.</P>
<P>Most sites have U.S. government information organized by subject, federal agency, or both.  In subject-oriented menus, most often government information is listed under a variety of subject areas, rather being contained in one &quot;government&quot; category.  Related topics that often include a large number of federal sites are demographics, economics, health and medicine, international affairs, politics, and law.  Many foreign government sites can be found under country categories, as well as international headings.</P>
<P>When searching for information from a particular federal agency, the best strategy is to begin with an agency-oriented menu, which lists all the branches and departments of the government in alphabetic order.</P>
<P>When searching for a particular document, limit your search to a particular database when possible.  If a likely source cannot be easily determined, a web-wide search will yield the best results.</P>
