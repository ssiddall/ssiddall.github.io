<P>The most comprehensive listing of electronic serials to date is maintained by the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC), an organization aligned with the Big Ten universities. In May, 1995, there were over 800 electronic journals listed.</P>
<P> At the system prompt type  GOPHER GOPHER.CIC.NET  R</P>
<P> Choose option 4, Electronic Serials, then choose option 2.</P>
<P> You may search alphabetically by title or display the complete list.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>It is important to note that CIC is maintaining an archive, which means that (1) many of the journals listed are no longer active, and (2) the most recent issues of the active journals may not be listed. It would always be wise to find the original source of the journal and send a query regarding publication schedule. </P>
<P>The best way to keep up with an ejournal of interest is to place your name on the distribution list, or &quot;subscribe&quot;, much as you would for an Internet discussion list. A list of ejournals with subscription information has been announced as being available this summer, and will be posted on KCINFO in the Library section.  </P>
<P>Ejournals today cover a wide area of subjects, with the academically oriented ones by far the best developed and the most consistent. The Table of Contents of a recent issue of the ejournal Postmodern Culture is appended for examination. </P>
<P>Please use the exercise attached for leads to other listings of ejournals and ebooks. See also Ed Krol's &quot;The Whole Internet&quot;, 2nd ed., pages 405406.</P>
<P>An issue surrounding ejournals as well as all etexts is readability  for ease of preparation and transmission they are usually sent in ASCII format with no capability for graphics and little capability for color and highlighting. Many critics of the movement toward electronic information sources and away from paper point to this as a major detriment</P>
<P>to the advancement of the electronic dissemination of information. Nevertheless the problem is not technically unresolvable. OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) has developed a Windowsbased interface for the journals it is now distributing. Called GUIDON, this interface enables color, a variety of type faces, highlighting, user control over the &quot;reading surface&quot;, and enlargement (&quot;zooming&quot;) ofthe text. Another tool, Netscape, is completely graphics based and does an excellent job of displaying both text and graphics, in a Windowsbased interface. The hypertext<A ID="I6" NAME="I6"></A>ual aspect of Netscape also adds another dimension  really many dimensions  to both the author's creation of the text and to the user's reception of the text. </P>
<P>Both techniques have limits and both are in early stages of development, but both prove that readability issues have technical solutions. </P>
<P>Many ejournals are now indexed in &quot;authoritative&quot; academic indices  the journal Postmodern Culture, for example, is in the MLA index available on CD-ROM in the Infolab in the Kenyon library.  Libraries have begun considering listing them in their catalogs as well, but many are waiting for the technology which will enable the user to not only identify the journal, but also ask to see the issues on the same terminal.</P>
<P>Ejournals will have an interesting future in academe. Steve Harnad, Editor of the ejournal Psycoloquy, suggested that the slow process of paper publication has been detrimental to scholarship. He stated in his paper &quot;What Scholars Want and Need From Electronic Journals&quot; that ejournals offer </P>
<P>&quot;(1) rapid, expert peerreview, (2) rapid copyediting, proofing and publication of accepted articles, (3) rapid, interactive, peer commentary, and (4) a permanent, universally accessible, searchable and retrievable electronic archive.&quot; </P>

<P>Ebooks are still in development. Limitations in terms of copyright, permissions, and the publishing industry's careful, concerned approach to the possibility of widespread pirating of protected texts, have all led to little movement toward the direction of the &quot;entire Library of Congress in the palm of your hand&quot;.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The largely volunteer Gutenberg project should not be slighted, though,  its efforts have yielded rich results  Moby Dick, Les Miserables (in English), The Federalist Papers. Yet the academic world is concerned that the controls necessary to warrant use are missing  there is seldom reference to the edition used, and no guarantee that the inputter did not make errors in transferring paper to text. The goal of the project is to provide something for the reader, not the researcher.</P>
<P>(On the subject of reliability, see the section Electronic Text Centers below.)</P>
<P>Interesting technologically, and in development on several levels, are etexts written in the hypertext format, and permitting links to other sources on the Internet. The electronic version of the Encyclopedia Brittanica permits the user to jump from an article on the Vatican toimages of the recent exhibit at the Library of Congress of materials from the Vatican Library. Perhaps following this concept a biographical dictionary of Nineteenth Century American authors could have links to representative works? This &quot;expanded book&quot; concept, suggested Laura Fillmore at the Internet 93 conference in December, 1993, may lead to a new category of jobs in publishing, that of the &quot;link editor&quot;. </P>
<P>An interesting question is whether the future of the ebook means the end of the book in paper. Todd J. B. Blayone, Editor of the bulletin ComputerAssisted Research Forum (vol. 2 no. 1) has suggested the terms of the debate as </P>
<P> In defense of the paper book:</P>
<P>      Usability</P>
<P>      Portability</P>
<P>      Readability</P>
<P>      Accessibility</P>
<P>      Bibliophilia</P>
<P> For the electronic book:</P>
<P>      Less expensive production process</P>
<P>      Less time needed to get text from the author to the reader</P>
<P>      No trees destroyed</P>
<P>      Electonic versions offer new ways to author, access, augment,</P>
<P>       and manipulate texts</P>
<P>To this might be added suggestions that group authorship and collaboration are made easier.</P>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER>
<P>A number of projects seek to find ways to distribute texts electronically to the academic world in ways that preserve the integrity of the work (for example an author's early draft, with corrections) and augment its use (for example, in a hypertext application references to names in Ulysses may be highlighted, and the reader enabled to &quot;jump&quot; to an explanation of the person, his role in the book, and other sections in which the name appears.)</P>
<P>The Electronic Text Center at the University of Virginia is working on the works of Immanuel Kant, the Global Jewish Database, Greek and Latin texts and images, and a hypertext edition of the works of Thomas Aquinas.</P>
<P>The Center For Electronic Texts in the Humanities, established jointly by Princeton University and Rutgers University in 1991, is inventorying electronic texts (the Inventory of MachineReadable Texts in the Humanities), developing works that may be placed onthe Internet, and providing educational programs to teach the techniques for text encoding. </P>
<P>For further information on these and other efforts please consult George P. Landow and Paul Delaney &quot;The Digital Word: TextBased Computing in the Humanities&quot;, The MIT Press, 1993. (A copy is owned by the Kenyon library  call number PN98 E4 D54 1993.)  Another excellent and uptodate source is the March 1994 issue of Information Technology and Libraries. This special issue is dedicated to the question &quot;Electronic Texts: Where Next?&quot; and is also owned by the </P>
<P>library. See both works for summaries of SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language), HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), and TEI (the Text Encoding Initiative).</P>

<P>Peter Hitchcock, &quot;'It Dread Inna Inglan': Linton Kwesi Johnson,</P>
<P>     Dread, and Dub Identity&quot;</P>
<P>          ABSTRACT: This essay examines the production of</P>
<P>     cultural voice in the work of Linton Kwesi Johnson (LKJ),</P>
<P>     the African/Caribbean/European dub poet.  It suggests that</P>
<P>     the doubledisplacement of an AfricanCaribbean Black living</P>
<P>     in England, diaspora upon diaspora, comes with a double</P>
<P>     indemnitymaking and history.  But what cultural logic</P>
<P>     obtains in the construction/reconstruction of subjectivity as</P>
<P>     subaltern, the articulation of the margin, the trace, the</P>
<P>     veve, that still allows a trenchant sense of history, of the</P>
<P>     need to make history?  Can we still conceive of subjects</P>
<P>     that make history, have a history to make, remake at a</P>
<P>     cocophanous rendezvous of victory?  To understand why this</P>
<P>     notion is not a mystery (the History, for instance, of</P>
<P>     imperialist certitude) but a problematic, one must</P>
<P>     understand what makes this history: one must come to terms</P>
<P>     with the history of the voice, what Kamus Braithwaite calls</P>
<P>     the &quot;invitation and challenge&quot; or what Edouard Glissant</P>
<P>     defines as &quot;literature&quot; and &quot;oraliture&quot; (the fragmented and</P>
<P>     therefore shared histories and voices of peoples).  One can</P>
<P>     read this history as an introduction in LKJ's sonorous beat,</P>
<P>     and one can see this history in a dissidence of voice, in</P>
<P>     all its synesthesia and dislocation.  PH</P>

<P>Stephanie Hammer, &quot;On the Bull's Horn with Peter Handke: Debates,</P>
<P>     Failures, Essays, and a Postmodern Livre de Moi&quot;</P>
<P>          ABSTRACT: This essay discusses Handke's critical</P>
<P>     reception as it pertains to the postmodern and &quot;reads&quot;</P>
<P>     Handke's recent essay series (the VERSUCHE) against a</P>
<P>     variety of concerns:  desire, castration, subjectivity, and</P>
<P>     the resonance of fatheressayist Michel de Montaigne. </P>
<P>     Handke's essays whittle away at the authority of traditional</P>
<P>     male subjectivity in graphic ways, as though performing a</P>
<P>     process of aesthetic selfcastration in payment of a new,</P>
<P>     legitimized subjectivity.  To paraphrase Michel Leiris,</P>
<P>     Handke's autobiographical doubles not only expose themselves</P>
<P>     to the bull's horn, they allow themselves to be gored; this</P>
<P>     reverse matadorian spectacle is at once the performance to</P>
<P>     which we are constantly invited and the radical cure which</P>
<P>     we might also enact upon ourselves.  SH</P>
<P>Eugene W. Holland, &quot;A Schizoanalytic Reading of Baudelaire: The</P>
<P>     Modernist as Postmodernist&quot;</P>
<P>          ABSTRACT: This schizoanalytic reading of Baudelaire</P>
<P>     draws on psychoanalytic, rhetorical, and</P>
<P>     historicalmaterialist interpretations in order to show that</P>
<P>     the historical momentum that carried Baudelaire out of</P>
<P>     romanticism into modernism also propelled him &quot;beyond&quot;</P>
<P>     modernism into a stance we recognize today as postmodern. </P>
<P>     Connecting Deleuze and Guattari's notion of &quot;decoding&quot; with</P>
<P>     the prevalence of metonymy over metaphor (in linguistic,</P>
<P>     rhetorical, and psychoanalytic terms [Jakobson, Barbara</P>
<P>     Johnson, and Lacan, respectively]) enables us to read the</P>
<P>     sonnet &quot;Beauty&quot; as a subversion of the metaphoric poetics of</P>
<P>     &quot;Correspondences&quot;a subversion that continues into the</P>
<P>     &quot;Parisian Tableaus&quot; section of _The Flowers of Evil_, and</P>
<P>     culminates in the split stance of the narrator in the prose</P>
<P>     poem collection.  This trajectory is fueled by Baudelaire's</P>
<P>     shock and dismay at the founding of a Second Empire on the</P>
<P>     ruins of the Second Republic.  While his modernism emerges</P>
<P>     in the ability to distance himself serenely from former</P>
<P>     romanticidealistic selves, his postmodernism lies in the</P>
<P>     recognition that the victims of Second Empire society he</P>
<P>     contemplates and depicts from afar are actually splitoff</P>
<P>     versions of former selves, with which he cannot help but</P>
<P>     identify.  EWH</P>
<P>Elizabeth Fay, &quot;Mapplethorpe's Art: Playing With the Byronic</P>
<P>     Postmodern&quot; </P>
<P>          ABSTRACT: There exist trenchant connections between</P>
<P>     Byron's romantic creation of himself as a literary figure,</P>
<P>     and Mapplethorpe's reinterpretation of the Byronic mode</P>
<P>     towards a postmodern creation of possible selves.  The</P>
<P>     verbal and photographic &quot;languages&quot; employed by both artists</P>
<P>     focus on issues that allow for a comparative analysis of</P>
<P>     &quot;staging,&quot; and what is termed here &quot;the byronic postmodern.&quot;</P>
<P>     Within this focus, the artistic meaning of &quot;staging&quot; applies</P>
<P>     to the artistic &quot;self&quot; in ways that seduce the viewer into a</P>
<P>     consuming appreciator of the artist's seemingly unlabored</P>
<P>     work.  It also entails a particular form of the visual</P>
<P>     contract normatively understood to exist between artist and</P>
<P>     viewer.  Byronic artists are equipped to understand the</P>
<P>     seductively teasing nature of this contract because they</P>
<P>     base their art on the bodily interplay made permissible</P>
<P>     between heteroand homosexual worlds by costuming and role</P>
<P>     playing.  EF</P>
<P>Lynda Hart, &quot;That Was Then: This Is Now: Exchanging the Phallus&quot;</P>
<P>          ABSTRACT: The concept of masochism has had to be</P>
<P>     rethought in light of recent developments in psychoanalysis,</P>
<P>     feminism, and gay and lesbian studies.  Bersani and others,</P>
<P>     for example, have suggested that submission may be sexually</P>
<P>     emancipatory for men, thus making it a privileged rather</P>
<P>     than an oppressed position; women, meanwhile, continue to be</P>
<P>     considered naturally rather than performatively masochistic,</P>
<P>     and thus unable to benefit from masochism as a strategy. </P>
<P>     Such conceptualizations of the reality and/or theatricality</P>
<P>     of masochism and pornography still require lesbianism to be</P>
<P>     a negative ontology.  The lesbian phallus, however,</P>
<P>     instigates a representational crisis by making no reference</P>
<P>     to the Real of the penis; it does not signify the</P>
<P>     persistence of a masculine or heterosexual identification. </P>
<P>     Rather, the lesbian phallus is the property of she who has</P>
<P>     given up what no one has.  [Ed.]</P>
<P>Martin Rosenberg, &quot;Dynamic and Thermodynamic Tropes of the</P>
<P>     Subject in Freud and in Deleuze and Guattari&quot;</P>
<P>          ABSTRACT: The descriptions of human consciousness in</P>
<P>     Freud and in Deleuze and Guattari are problematic precisely</P>
<P>     in their inverse, mirrored opposition, and we may discover</P>
<P>     the &quot;ground&quot; for that opposition by examining the role</P>
<P>     played by tropes from the discipline of physics in these</P>
<P>     theorists' representations of subjectivity.  We will need to</P>
<P>     notice the historical differences in the ideological use of</P>
<P>     these tropes.  Yet, even contemporary theories of tropes</P>
<P>     have had recourse to the discipline of physics in order to</P>
<P>     model how tropes work.  Drawing on Ilya Prigogine's</P>
<P>     confrontation with the rhetoricity governing a &quot;clash of</P>
<P>     doctrines&quot; between timereversible (dynamic) and</P>
<P>     timeirreversible (thermodynamic) assumptions underlying</P>
<P>     investigations in the physical sciences, we will examine</P>
<P>     first the role of oppositional tropes from physics in</P>
<P>     theories of tropes.  Second, we will observe the role that</P>
<P>     these tropes play in representing the subject: in Freud's</P>
<P>     &quot;The Dreamwork,&quot; in Laplanche and Pontalis' account of</P>
<P>     Freud's subjectsystems, and in Stallybrass and White's</P>
<P>     account of the unconscious as the site of the carnivalesque.</P>
<P>     We will then show how Deleuze and Guattari's representations</P>
<P>     of the subject in terms of the nomad and the rhizome, simply</P>
<P>     invert Freud's valorizing of the dynamic laws controlling</P>
<P>     thermodynamic processes, arguing instead for the celebration</P>
<P>     of the contingent and the indeterminate.  In a telling</P>
<P>     passage on chess and Go as game theories of war in which</P>
<P>     chess becomes the discourse of %physis%, while Go becomes</P>
<P>     the discourse of %nomos%, Deleuze and Guattari seek to hide</P>
<P>     their own claims for a timeirreversible model of cultural</P>
<P>     resistance &quot;grounded&quot; in natural laws of a different sort</P>
<P>     than those justifying the rules of domination governing</P>
<P>     subjectivity and society since the Industrial </P>
<P>     Revolution.  MER</P>
