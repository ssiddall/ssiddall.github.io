<p>Over the past four years we have designed and built a number of
distance education classrooms at National University. While the
basic design has been similar, each time we find ourselves
reevaluating earlier decisions in the light of present needs.
Because this issue is a recurring one for distance education
practitioners, discussing design decisions may prove useful to
others faced with designing a room for video teleconferencing.</p>

<p>First and foremost, we must decide how the room will be used.
Will it be used primarily as a teaching site, a receiving location,
or a combination of both? Also, will the facility be used by other
members of the institution for other purposes?</p>

<p>If the room is primarily a teaching site from which instructors
will be facilitating a course, then the first decision involves
control of the equipment. This single decision, more than any
other, will guide the overall design. This question is a difficult
one, and not everyone will be pleased with the decision.
Instructors who see themselves as technologically "savvy" will want
control over the cameras and shot sequence; others will be very
thankful if they do not have to worry about the technology and can
rely on a technician to take charge. In many cases, the answer to
this question is based on the institution's structure. Does the
institution offer courses on a semester system, a quarter system,
or, as in the case of National University, on a monthly basis? The
answer will influence the schedules of faculty who need to be
oriented to the distance education room in terms of course
preparation and comfort with the equipment. Those fortunate enough
to be able to spend four months or more with faculty members
preparing them to teach through video teleconferencing will likely
succeed in teaching instructors to manipulate cameras, audio, and
images in a way that does not detract from the learning process.
Those without this luxury of time may want to consider designing
the teaching location based on a more traditional broadcast model,
where technicians control the cameras, audio levels, video feeds,
and character generation, thus allowing the instructor to focus on
facilitating the learning process. This latter model also provides
some latitude in terms of the sophistication of equipment
installed.</p>

<p>For simplicity this discussion assumes that the location to be
designed is primarily a teaching site. This assumption will allow
us to look at further design issues related to the two models
outlined above.</p>

<h3>THE BROADCAST MODEL</h3>

This model has both benefits and drawbacks for designing an
institutional facility. The broadcast model allows use of a smaller
classroom as a studio for the instructor and students, but also
requires an adjacent room, somewhat larger than a closet, for use
as the control room. At National, typical dimensions for our
teaching classrooms/studios, which seat up to thirty students, are
thirty feet by thirty feet. Locating equipment in the classrooms so
that it can be controlled by the instructor would require a larger
room; in the broadcast model, however, most of the equipment is
located in the control room. 

<p>Equipment required in a typical classroom/studio based on the
broadcast model includes, but is not limited to, cameras,
microphones, an instructor's station, and monitors. Design
considerations for each of these components is discussed below.</p>

<p>* Cameras. Three cameras are needed: an instructor camera, a
student camera, and a document or overhead camera for slides and
still images. The instructor and student cameras should be
three-chip CCD types that provide a high-quality video signal. This
consideration is important since even the best CODECs will degrade
the signal as they digitize and compress it prior to transmission
over the telephone lines. A single-chip CCD camera is adequate for
the document camera since the signal degradation will not be as
severe when still images are run through the CODEC.</p>

<p>* Microphones. Also needed is a series of push-to-talk
microphones, at least one for every two students. In our design we
have experimented with a variety of microphones and microphone
placement options, from ceiling-mounted microphones to single
microphones used by one or two students. While the ceiling-mounted
microphones were aesthetically more pleasing, they did not work
well, particularly in filtering ambient room noise. The signal to
noise ratio was so high that student input could not successfully
compete with noise from the air conditioning system, low-level
student conversation, even the occasional crunching of Dorito
chips! Ceiling-mounted microphones also are subject to building
code restrictions.</p>

<p>We have also experimented with table-mounted open microphones,
but these had similar problems with ambient room noise. Another
major problem with open gated microphones was related to the echo
cancellation software/hardware of the video teleconferencing
systems. It appeared that the systems had been specifically
designed to work with only one or two cardioid microphones; when
trying to adjust the room to a series of open microphones the
feedback algorithm did not work. These problems are currently being
addressed with the use of push-to-talk microphones, which eliminate
the need to constantly adjust the gain to account for room noise
and have overcome the difficulties experienced with the echo
cancellation systems.</p>

<p>* Instructor's Station. The instructor's station should be
supported by a variety of equipment: computers for display of
digital presentations or access to the Internet, wireless
microphones, pointing devices, a monitor which displays the signal
being transmitted, a scan converter for the computer, and, possibly
a display station for use with an answer response system similar to
OneTouch.</p>

<p>* Monitors. In addition to the monitor on the instructor's
station, two larger monitors, no less than 35 inches in diameter,
should be installed. One monitor should be mounted at the front of
the room in line with the student camera and the other at the rear
of the room in line with the instructor camera. The audio from the
remote site may be played through either the monitors or a separate
sound system. Our experiments with a variety of monitors and
television receivers indicate that adequate viewing of text on the
screen and presentations made from the remote locations
necessitates 1) a screen size of at least 35 inches, and 2)
mounting/support of these monitors that will allow for a clear line
of sight from anywhere in the classroom.</p>

<p>The specifications outlined above are minimum requirements for
the design of a videoconferencing classroom. The importance of good
audio cannot be over-emphasized. Nothing will destroy the
reputation of the system faster than poor audio quality. Students
seem willing to adjust to the less-than-optimal quality of thirty
frames/second video transmission, but will complain adamantly about
poor audio quality.</p>

<p>The broadcast model offers a great deal of flexibility in terms
of the type and quality of equipment installed in the control room.
The trained technicians running each class are able to control a
wide range of technology. There are, however, a series of decisions
that need to be made prior to the final design. A few of these
decisions deal with the issue of camera controls and video
recording of class sessions. There are two options for camera
controls: either the technicians will control the cameras through a
remote pan and tilt system or equipment similar to CameraMan, which
has an infrared tracking system to automatically track the person
wearing the transmitter, can be installed. We have experimented
with both and have come to rely on the remote pan and tilt systems,
which give the technician ultimate control over the shots.</p>

<p>If class sessions are to be video recorded, a high-end edit deck
in the control room will facilitate the process. These decks are
designed for long hours of use and will hold up much better than
less expensive consumer models or commercial playback/record
decks.</p>

<p>Following are what we have found to be the minimum video
equipment requirements for the control room:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pan and tilt control system for the operation of the cameras in
the classroom</li>

<li>A series of black and white preview monitors: one for each
camera, one for the remote site, and one for the signal being sent
to the record deck</li>

<li>Two commercial SVHS play decks and one commercial SVHS record
deck</li>

<li>Preview monitors for each VCR deck and the record deck</li>

<li>A character generator for text and a color preview monitor</li>

<li>One waveform and vector scope to allow for color correction on
classroom cameras</li>

<li>One 13 inch or 15 inch program monitor which displays the
signal which is being broadcast</li>

<li>A video switcher that allows switching of video feeds and
application of a variety of special effects</li>
</ul>

Audio equipment requirements include the following: 

<ul>
<li>An audio sound mixer, microphone mixers, and amplifier</li>

<li>Speakers that allow monitoring of the outgoing signal</li>

<li>Headphones that will allow the technician to hear the signal
without ambient sound from the room noise</li>

<li>Cassette deck and CD player for music</li>
</ul>

<p>Other equipment which is desirable, but not essential, includes
laserdisc players, computers with NTSC boards installed, and
testing equipment.</p>

<p>Of course the key to these systems is the video CODEC,
multiplexes, and audio cancellation boards that facilitate the
change of the analog to digital signals that can be transmitted
over regular telephone lines. These systems sit behind the control
equipment with output video and audio feeds from the audio mixer
and video switcher feeding into the CODEC.</p>

<p>The physical design of the control room is a matter of personal
choice and often depends on the configuration of the room. A window
equipped with one-way glass will allow the technician to make quick
visual reference checks of the room in case of technical
problems.</p>

<h3>INSTRUCTOR-CONTROLLED MODEL</h3>

The main difference between the instructor-control model and the
broadcast model is the absence of a control room. The classroom
design in this model is similar to that in the broadcast model;
however, additional monitors, a small video signal selector, and a
small-group video teleconferencing system are additional equipment
requirements. 

<p>The presence of the small-group video teleconferencing system in
the classroom triggers the most critical design decision, that of
placement of cameras and monitors. Those who have seen these
systems in operation know that they have two basic configurations:
single monitor and dual monitor. The main camera for the systems is
a compact one-chip CCD camera with a built-in pan and tilt that
sits on top of one of the monitors located on a cart. In most
cases, the small-group system should face the students so that they
can see the remote site(s), any information that the instructor
puts on the document camera, and other video signals being
displayed. A second camera on a pan and tilt will be controlled by
the instructor from the instructor's station. Additionally, a large
monitor will need to be mounted in line with the instructor's
camera to enable viewing of the remote site(s) as they are
presenting.</p>

<p>The instructor's station is another major consideration in the
room design. The instructor will be controlling the audio levels
and video signals that go to the remote sites and to the local
monitor in the on-site classroom; cueing up videotapes, audiotapes,
and CDs, and controlling the cameras. As a result, the instructor's
station needs to be modified or purchased with these functions in
mind. Several companies now provide a touch-screen interface that
will interact with the CODEC and the auxiliary video and audio
components to provide the instructor with an intuitive means by
which he or she can control the equipment. Integrating one of these
systems into the design is highly recommended. Also necessary are
SVHS record and play decks, as well as audiocassette and CD
players. These items, which are all situated in the control room in
the broadcast model, must now become part of the instructor's
station or be controlled from the instructor's station. The
configuration of the microphones should remain the same as in the
broadcast model and should be fed into gated microphone mixers
prior to being fed into a soundboard. This configuration offers
maximum control over the audio characteristics of the room.</p>

<p>There is no one right way to design a room for instruction via
two-way video/audio teleconferencing. Cost, the instructional
environment, the institution's course structure, and the
availability of instructors for training are critical
considerations in design decisions. Contact with others who are
practitioners in the field can provide valuable insights into what
has worked and not worked with their room designs. Each generation
of small-group systems brings with it innovations that may address
previous obstacles, and those who have experimented with recent
installations are often the best resources for designing a video
teleconferencing classroom.</p>
