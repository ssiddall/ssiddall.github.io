<h1 align="CENTER">Example renovations for Videoconferencing
Systems</h1>

The following is a list of renovations required for Kenyon's remote
collaboration classroom: 

<p>(1) New carpeting. Color to coordinate with walls (see
below).</p>

<p>(2) Wood valance installed above white board on north side of
room. The purpose is to hide the fact that this white board covers
a window.</p>

<p>(3) Windows treatments: three of the four need room darkening
pull-down shades AND drapes that are inset into window well. The
window behind the white board on the north side probably doesn't
need drapes, only shades.</p>

<p>(4) Remove two white boards: the one on the eastern wall and one
on the southern wall.</p>

<p>(5) Additional drapery: two tracks of drapes, ceiling to floor,
need to be hung in north and east sides, to meet at the corner when
drawn back. This will require a diagram. The drapes should run from
the mid-point of the north wall to the corner, and from the corner
along the east wall to cover the norhtern-most window. The color of
the drapes should coordinate with the wall color (see below) and
carpet, and have no pattern. Solid color only. These drapes, by the
way, are largely for sound control and for providing a good
backdrop for the speaker during a video session.</p>

<p>(6) The incandescent track lights are fine and should remain,
but the fluorescent lights are not sufficiently bright. We need to
add more and/or install full sized baffles (they are half-size
now). The goal is to have 3500 deg K lighting in the room.</p>

<p>(7) Paint all walls. Benjamin Moore color "Eggshell Blue"
#1678.</p>

<p>Seating in the room is fine as is, but we need some narrow,
trapezoidal conference tables to move around the room as needed in
different configurations. This purchase will wait until after the
room is mostly finished. We don't want to eliminate chairs from the
room, but we want the option of some seating at tables for more
traditional videoconference uses. Seating will be 18-20 in the
end.</p>
