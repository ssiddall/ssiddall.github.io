<h1 align="CENTER">Advice for Videoconferencing Systems from
Hamilton College</h1>

In particular the rooms should:

<p>1) enable a small group of students and faculty at one school to
interact using voice video, and computer technologies with a
similar group at another school. For the purposes of discussion we
use ten as a maximum size for each group. Larger groups might be
accommodated, albeit suboptimally. In particular, the groups should
be able to clearly see and hear each other, and display information
to each other. A group sitting around an appropriately designed
seminar table is the model used here.</p>

<p>2) enable groups of students and faculty to use
computing/Internet resources as part of the interactive classroom.
However, rather than put desktop computers at place where students
would sit, we recommend that network connections be available at
each location and that laptop computers be available whenever
needed, and stored in a locked cabinet.</p>

<p>3) utilize digital "compressed video" technology. This is the
approach used by Picturetel and VTel equipment. The video image is
digitized and transmitted across multiple (up to three) ISDN
telephone lines. This approach has several advantages: (a) each
classroom can connect to sites other than Hamilton or Colgate to
further collaboration. For example, a public policy class at
Hamilton can interact with a senator in Washington, D. C. if he or
she is able to go to a suitably equipped facility. Such rooms are
becoming readily available in major cities and at universities; (b)
The cost of the ISDN lines is based upon a monthly rental and a per
minute usage charge. This enables the colleges to accurately
estimate the cost of usage, and only pay for what is used; (c) As
the digital technology improves the cost of the rented lines will
likely decrease.</p>

<p>Some things we learned:</p>

<p>1) Pick flexible furniture (can be rearranged in different ways
and to accommodate different size groups). The tables we picked
were too deep and while they folded up they didn't roll. Since then
I have seen narrower tables that roll that would have given us more
flexibility.</p>

<p>2) We have found that our room can hold 15 comfortably with the
tables and providing proper viewing for the person on the other
end. When we go more than that we move everything out of the way
and use traditional chairs with tablet arms. This allows up to 25
in the same space. Pretty tight but it enables the person on the
other end to see everyone.</p>

<p>3) The limelight camera that sits on the front monitor is VERY
important. This camera moves silently and will autozoom and focus
on the speaker (hands-off operation). This makes it possible to
teach someone how to do a simple videoconference in 15 minutes and
also provides a really nice view by the remote site of someone
speaking.</p>

<p>4) We also purchased a cameraman tracking camera that allows a
person in front of the room to move around and have the camera
track him/her. We have used this much less but Colgate has made use
of it. Almost all our uses have been for videoconference type
activities.</p>

<p>5) Equip the room with all variety of multimedia input devices
(computer, cd, videodisk, vhs, slidecamera,...) they will be used.
We also put a ceiling mounted lcd projector and that is used
heavily in the room. This room has become the best multimedia room
on campus and that's a problem for us as others want to use it.
Priority is given for use of the Picturetel stuff.(see guidelines
below)</p>

<p>6)Acoustics, lighting and ventilating are important. Our room
had problems with all of these at the beginning (this is why we
were able to get it). Make sure that your room is good in all these
three or you can fix the problems.</p>
