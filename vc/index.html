<H2>Remote Collaboration Classrooms at Denison and Kenyon</h2>

Our goal here is to present a brief executive summary of the processes we used to evaluate, select, install and begin using the two new "remote collaboration classrooms" now in operation at Denison University and Kenyon College as part of the Mellon-funded program, "<a href="http://enhanced-learning.org/mellon/">Collaboration with Technology</a>."

<h2>The Video Conferencing Cookbook</h2>
<a href="http://www.vide.net" target=_parent>The Video Conferencing Cookbook</a> is accessible at the ViDe (Video Development Initiative) site.

This comprehensive web site has been built by member institutions of the Southeastern Universities Research Association.  The Cookbook provides an overview of videoconferencing applications, a glossary of terms, and practical steps for setting up systems.  Highly recommended background reading.
