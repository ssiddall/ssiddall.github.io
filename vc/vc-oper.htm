<h1 align="CENTER">Operation of Videoconferencing Systems</h1>

There are web-based <a href="vc-classroom.html">descriptions of the
facilities</a> and <a href="vc-policy.html">policy statements</a>
for the routine operation of the remote collaboration classrooms.
Kenyon's remote collaboration classroom is located in Ascension
Hall room 25. Principal contact for use of the room is Larry
Tucker, <a href="mailto:tuckerl@kenyon.edu">tuckerl@kenyon.edu</a>.


<p>Denison's remote collaboration classroom is located in the
Learning Resources Center, room 115. <a href="vc-facil.htm">Images
of the facility</a> are available. Principal contact for use of the
room is Ron Howard, <a href="mailto:howardr@denison.edu">

<h2>Management team</h2>

Coordination among the various support units is vital for the
smooth operation of a video conference facility. This includes the
people involved in scheduling the facility, training clients on its
use, audio-visual services, network support, telecommunications
support and vendor liaisons. In our project that involves Kenyon
and Denison, there are two responsibile parties for each of these
functions. To meet the need for strong coordination, we've
identified the people involved and convene meetings on a regular
basis, using the video conferencing systems, of course. 

<h2>Current issues</h2>

We have been very disappointed with the video scan converters
installed in the systems. The Extron units cost us $1800+ each and
convert VGA signals into NTSC for presentation on video monitors
locally, and for input into the Tandberg codecs for transmission to
the other end of a conference. The data loss is simply too great
from scan conversion. This is a fault of the technology, not these
particular models of converters. For example, if we surf to a web
site on the computer in the remote collaboration classroom, we can
barely read textual information on the local TV monitor. Some
further degradation occurs when the converted images are sent over
the codec, but not much. The major loss is in conversion from VGA
to NTSC. 

<p>We are currently experimenting with several web-based
applications that allow one browser to "lead" another in a
master-slave relationship. For example, <a href=
"http://www.webex.com">WebEx</a> provides this service. This allows
both ends of a conference to project high-quality images taken
directly from the local computer without scan conversion.</p>

<p>We have several less commonly taught language projects being
taught, and for these, especially the beginning language classes,
the quality of audio is important. We are implementing several
improvements in 2000: more and better mics, adding a mixer and
equalizer, distributed speakers (not just those on the TV
monitors).</p>

<p>Faculty who have seen or are planning to use Kenyon and
Denison's facilities in classes are planning some face-to-face
meetings at the beginning, middle and end of each semester.</p>

<p>Electrical brown-outs can wreak havoc with the video systems.
Recent voltage drops have damaged the power distribution panels and
other major elements of the systems. Uninterruptible power supplies
should be installed not so much to keep the systems running during
a black out, but more to protect them from voltage drops.</p>

<p>Both campuses have switched from AT&amp;T and Sprint as long
distance carriers to Qwest as part of sound fiscal moves for voice
telephone services. These changes, however, can affect ISDN
services. For instance, Qwest at the outset provides 56, not
64kbps, per channel ISDN services. This slows the ISDN
transmissions slightly, but not noticeably. Changes in billing
procedures have been more problematic than the technical problems,
again in part because the carriers have less experience with ISDN,
data and video than we'd like. These experiences suggest that
IP-based video conferencing may be easier to support once the
"quality of services" issues are resolved.</p>

<p>Electrical service for lights should be planned carefully to
give as much flexibility as possible. Don't put all ceiling lights
on one switch; break them up so that lighting can be varied as
needs dictate.</p>

<p>Don't stuff the rooms with too many seats. It reduces the ease
with which the room can be reconfigured for each class.
Realistically, video confernecing systems with one to three cameras
can handle only about 18-20 students at most, no more than three
rows deep.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that the facility be scheduled only for
events and classes that need to use the video conferencing systems.
Visitors are often curious and can alter system settings
incidentally by their curiosity. For each hour of class use, the
facility probably needs another hour of maintenance and testing
time.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that the facility be placed in proximity
to the offices of the support staff responsible for the systems,
and that specific individuals be charged with oversight of the
facility.</p>
