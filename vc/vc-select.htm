<h1 align="CENTER">Selection of Videoconferencing Systems</h1>

Pooling all information about videoconferencing systems, we
confirmed the list of criteria that we had been refining all along:


<ul>
<li>best possible first experience for our faculty, suggesting
tried-and-true H.320 compatible systems (ISDN-based
circuit-switched networks)</li>

<li>clear potential for the selected system to participate
eventually with H.323 compatible systems (Internet-based on IP
networks).</li>

<li>easy-to-use control system so that faculty will need only 15-20
minute training on the basics, and so they can use the systems
successfully on an infrequent basis without a refresher course</li>

<li>both ISDN and network-based codecs so we can connect to each
other over existing dedicated network lines (IP) yet still dial out
to reach other sites (ISDN).</li>
</ul>

Other criteria such as vendor reputation, market share, and cost
came into play during our final selection. 

<p>In particular because of the AMX-manufactured control interface
for the Tandberg system, and strong reference reports from other
sites, we selected the Tandberg Educator 5000 package. PictureTel
was a strong contender, and had a great deal of emphasis on future
IP-based videoconferencing systems. Especially with Denison's major
new network initiatives in partnership with Cisco, we felt that it
will be critical to watch these developments. Traditional
H.320-based systems can be connected to H.323 based (IP) systems
through gateways even now, but the best course of investment in
this area remains unclear. The selection of the Tandberg systems
was a conservative choice but one that would enable our faculties
to begin immediately to experiment with the best possible remote
collaboration performance.</p>

<p>As we moved toward the final selection of systems for Denison
and Kenyon, we began to confront non-technical issues which were
vital to the success of the effort: <b>finding a space to
dedicate</b> to the videoconferencing systems, and planning for <b>
space renovations</b>. Denison considered placing the VC systems in
a newly renovated conference room but upon hearing that flexibility
in room layout was critical, decided to locate the remote
collaboration classroom in the Learning Resources Center. Kenyon
negotiated with the registrar to identify a classroom that could be
dedicated and found one in Ascension Hall. Neither of our rooms are
exclusively dedicated to video conferencing, and they should be to
minimize disruption to the systems, changes in setups from the
curious, conflicts that prevent testing new connections, etc.</p>

<p>We also began to understand that our local telephone companies
would provide some challenges as well. While Denison's telephone
company could provide ISDN services needed to connect traditional
videoconferencing systems to others worldwide, Kenyon's phone
company had yet to bring ISDN services into Gambier.</p>
