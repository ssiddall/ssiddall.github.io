<h3>Policies for the reservation and use of our Remote
Collaboration Classrooms</h3>

<h5>Denison University: Library Lower Level Room 115</h5>

<h5>Kenyon College: Ascension Hall room 25</h5>
</center>

Reservations must be made through e-mail by contacting the
appropriate facility manager(s):

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Mr. Ron Howard at Denison University, <a href=
"mailto:howardr@denison.edu">howardr@denison.edu</a>, or
(740)587-6485</li>

<li>Mr. Larry Tucker at Kenyon College, <a href=
"mailto:tuckerl@kenyon.edu">tuckerl@kenyon.edu</a>, or
(740)427-5707</li>
</ul>

<b>ADVANCE NOTICE IS REQUIRED</b> for all reservations as follows:

<p>For sessions between Denison University and Kenyon College - <b>
24 hours advance notice</b><br>
For sessions involving any other site(s) with which we have
conducted video conferences in the past three months - <b>One week
(seven days) advance notice</b><br>
For sessions involving any other site(s) with which we have not
conducted a video conference in the past three months - <b>Two
weeks (fourteen days) advance notice</b><br>
Multipoint sessions that require a bridging service (such as
V-Span) will normally require one full week (seven days) of advance
notice.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the person making the reservation to
identify the videoconference facility to which they wish to
connect. Lists of worldwide videoconferencing
facilities are available on the Internet. The proposer must also provide the
name and telephone number of the individual responsible for the
other end of the proposed videoconference.</p>

<p>A test session must be conducted between Kenyon and any
videoconference site that we have not worked with in the past three
months. Support for videoconference tests is handled by the
facility managers (noted above). They will schedule the test for a
period of time prior to the event for which the room has been
reserved. Given that there may be competing uses for the
classrooms, there may be times when the required test cannot be
scheduled before the proposed session. It is also possible that a
test will disclose a technical problem that prevents our running as
session with the new site. In either case, it may be necessary to
alter plans for the videoconference session. The facility managers
will notify the person making the reservation if there are any
technical problems or scheduling conflicts.</p>

<p>Reservations for sessions between Denison and Kenyon or with
sites to which we have connected in the past three months do not
normally require a test prior to the planned event.</p>

<p>Prior to any videoconference, the facilities managers or their
assistants will provide a brief introduction to the operation of
the facility to those who will operate the systems. Additional
printed instructions are available in the classroom. The
institutions do not have the staff resources to provide on-site
technical support during each session. A campus telephone is
located in each classroom but we cannot guarantee that someone will
be able to respond immediately. Videoconference sponsors should
prepare alternative plans in the event that technical problems
disrupt a session.</p>

<p>Videoconference sponsors should arrange for access to the rooms
which are locked at all times when not in use.</p>

<p>The costs of long distance telephone calls for videoconferences
will not be billed back to the session sponsor at this time. We
wish to encourage uses of the facility and so college telephone
operations will cover these costs through the end of the 1999-2000
academic year as the utility of the remote collaboration classroom
is tested. After that time, the costs of operating the facility
will be reevaluated and telephone costs may be charged back to
session sponsors.</p>
