<h1 align="CENTER">Proposed Goals for Videoconferencing
Systems</h1>

Remote collaboration facilities (part of the Denison-Kenyon
proposal) 

<p>Many of the collaborative learning experiences we are planning
will be facilitated through the use of modern videoconferencing
systems we propose to install at both campuses. Recent
technological developments have made it possible for audiences and
speakers to engage in unencumbered, fully-interactive conversations
at different locations. Videoconferencing systems such as the
Picturetel Concorde allow speakers to address audiences both in
their local setting as well as remotely and to field questions and
reply to remote audiences with nearly equal ease as to local
participants. Video and audio quality is as high as broadcast
television. Cameras track speakers eliminating the need for
constant support staff while minimizing the artificial nature of
video interactions. The establishment of industry standards for
videoconferencing systems has opened up many new possibilities for
such sessions. Our opportunities will expand as all campuses of the
Five Colleges of Ohio consortium engage with these technologies,
along with those who are now pioneering curricular and
administrative uses of videoconferencing in the northeast (Colgate,
Hamilton, Skidmore, Lafayette, Lehigh, Bates, Bowdoin, Colby and
others).</p>

<p>Our colleagues at these institutions are using videoconferencing
to conduct joint classes in computer science, less commonly taught
foreign languages, and classics. Hamilton faculty on conference
travel have maintained class meetings and brought international
authorities to their classes using the technology. Kinkos Inc. has
set up such compatible systems in more than 150 locations
worldwide. One can imagine a broad array of interactions with
speakers and other classes with these technologies.</p>

<p>Many as yet unimagined collaborative activities will be
facilitated as well. For example, our colleagues at Colgate and
Hamilton have begun a series of monthly, informal videoconferences
in which faculty exchange ideas and plan joint programs. This is
precisely the level of inter-institutional collaboration we seek to
foster between Kenyon and Denison. Our colleagues have noted a
great deal of enthusiasm for videoconferencing among faculty who
have used it, characterizing the experience as "lots of fun" which
encourages further use. Videoconferencing will enhance our
collaborative efforts but will not replace face-to-face
interchanges among faculty and students in this program. As a
result, in our final assessments, we will be able to compare and
contrast the value of "same time, same place" with "same time,
different place" approaches.</p>

<p>Our plan is to equip one classroom on each campus with the
videoconferencing features we select from site visits and
conversations with our colleagues at the northeastern colleges
noted above. Capital costs for the systems ($65,000 for each
campus, exclusive of any costs of renovation) are included in the
proposed budget as are operational budgets ($3,000 per year for
each campus) for the tenure of the grant.</p>
