<h1 align="CENTER">Installation of Videoconferencing Systems</h1>

Our contract with Tandberg included a penalty clause in the
purchase order so that we were assured of timely installation. This
brought upon us a burden to prepare the spaces for the installation
and to see that ISDN lines and network connections were ready.
Tandberg's equipment was delivered and the installer arrived at a
time when Kenyon was not ready with ISDN lines and Denison was not
ready with the dedicated network installation. This logistical
failure made it impossible to test the systems between the two
schools at the time of initial installation but we were able to
resolve the issues over time without another visit by the
installer. 

<p>Planning for the installation was the most complex part of the
entire effort. It probably would not have been possible without a
face-to-face meeting of all involved parties (which actually took
place prior to the issuance of the purchase order, adding pressure
for interested parties to attend). Attending were: Kenyon and
Denison network staff, telecommunications management, Mellon grant
director, and media services staff. They were joined by technical
and sales representatives of Tandberg, representatives from
Kenyon's local telephone provider who also support Kenyon's Nortel
phone switch, and a representative from Cisco who spoke to
Denison's networking plans. Without such a meeting, it is doubtful
that the installation would have been even as "smooth" as it
was.</p>

<p>Software in Kenyon's telephone switch had to be upgraded to
allow ISDN services to pass through to the videoconferencing
systems, but in addition, it was clear that Kenyon could save money
by converting all incoming trunk lines for both phone as well as
video and other data to ISDN lines. This larger project then became
part of the videoconferencing project which added complexity but in
the end, will save the college significant trunking costs.</p>

<p>At Denison, the local telephone company installed ISDN lines
that bypassed the campus telephone switch and went directly to the
classroom.</p>

<p>At neither Kenyon or Denison is it currently possible to log
long distance phone call costs on the ISDN lines through our
routine long distance management systems. Kenyon's authorization
codes are suffixes to calls and suffixes cannot be used with the
Tandberg systems. Prefixes can be used by the Tandberg system but
would not be easily tracked. Both campuses have agreed to
underwrite the costs of long distance services for
videoconferencing during the first year to 18 months of operations
as a way of encouraging departments' experimentation.</p>

<p>Room renovations are site-specific issues, but the details of
the renovations at Kenyon are <a href="vc-reno.htm">available</a>
as examples.</p>
