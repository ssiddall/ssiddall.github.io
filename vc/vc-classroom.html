Denison's and Kenyon's new remote collaboration classrooms were
established through a grant by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The
objective of this faculty development grant is to enhance learning
through collaboration that uses modern information technology. More
about the grant is available at the Mellon Program's web site, <a
