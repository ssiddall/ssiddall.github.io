<h1 align="CENTER">Notes from PictureTel demo of Videoconferencing
Systems</h1>

On May 15, several of us at Denison and Kenyon went to
Communications III in Columbus to participate in a
videoconferencing demonstration. We were using a PictureTel
Concorde 4500 system (that which Hamilton, Colgate, etc use) to
videoconference with a representative of First Virtual Corporation,
a partner of PictureTel that makes LAN-based videoconferencing
products. The purpose of our trip was to see some of these sytems
in action and to find out more about the future of ISDN-based and
TCP/IP-based videoconferencing systems. 

<p>We learned that the videoconferencing industry, which has been
largely based on proprietary coding-decoding systems (codecs), is
working quickly to incorporate, or at least be able to communicate
with, the newer, TCP/IP-based desktop systems. While the
incorporation of desktop video systems is not high on our list of
system requirements, we don't want to get involved with systems
that aren't headed in this direction without a major upgrade. On
the other hand, if we want to be able to move our videoconferencing
systems around campus, or to acquire more than one, we are likely
to have to consider how we'll network them at these locations. For
now, the usual approach is to terminate some ISDN lines at a
specific location and connection to that fixed location. The new
videoconferencing systems will allow us to use ATM-based campus
networks to locate our systems at more than one location fixed by
the ISDN terminations. The new systems will eventually allow us to
use ATM protocols to integrate on- and off-campus desktop video
systems into our classroom-to-classroom videoconferences.</p>

<p>Note the prominence of ATM in this future. Larry Tucker heard
much the same at the teleconference meeting he attended in March.
ATM is the current network standard for assuring quality of service
since it allows some part of the bandwidth to be set aside for
video data.</p>

<p>At the demo, we learned that PictureTel and First Virtual have
desktop add-ons for $800 that allow a desktop system to receive
conference mateirals over ATM, and for $3000 that allow a desktop
to receive and send videoconference materials over ATM (that
includes the ATM network interface card). First Virtual also makes
a Vcache product for storing parts or all of a videoconference to
disk so that it can be referenced and pulled up at a later date.
More information about First Virtual is at www.fvc.com [Note: in
the end, these features were not considered important in our
selection]</p>
