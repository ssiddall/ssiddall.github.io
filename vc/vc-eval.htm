<h1 align="CENTER">Evaluation of Videoconferencing Systems</h1>

Planning efforts began in February, 1998, even before we knew
officially that we had funds from the Mellon Foundation to
experiment with videoconferencing in the liberal arts. Some goals
of the "remote collaboration classrooms" portion of our proposal to
the Mellon Foundation are <a href="vc-mellon.htm">available</a>.

<p>Several groups at both campuses were involved including
telecommunications, computing, media services and the proposers of
the Mellon grant. We all began to read more background materials
about videoconferencing technology and <a href="vc-design.htm">
classroom design</a> since none of us had significant background in
the field. Larry Tucker (Kenyon media services, tuckerl@kenyon.edu)
attended the <a href="http://www.imcca.org">International
TeleConferencing Association</a> meeting in Philadephia in March,
1998, garnering much new information about mainstream vendors of VC
(videoconferencing) systems.</p>

<p>We met in late April, 1998, armed with background materials and
<a href="vc-smallen.htm">advice</a> from Dave Smallen of Hamilton
College where they've been using remote collaboration approaches
for two years. We submitted an informal <a href="vc-rfp.htm">
request for quotes</a>.</p>

<p>We began to look at vendor demonstrations in May. Notes on the
Picturetel demo are <a href="vc-ptel.htm">available</a>. We were
disappointed with the presentation by Accent Communications of the
Fujitsu systems. We viewed the Tandberg systems at Ohio State
University's facility.</p>

<p>As a result of these demonstrations, we refined our equipment
needs, reducing the number of classroom cameras to two and removing
the need for voice-activated cameras (those that track the speaker
based on sound). We added a VCR to our planned configurations. We
had discussed an interactive whiteboard at each location but put
this idea into the background until our faculties and staff gained
experience with the basic videoconference concept.</p>

<p>From these experiences, we determined a list of criteria and
entered the <a href="vc-select.htm">selection phase</a> of the
process.</p>
