<h1 align="CENTER">Request for Quotes for Videoconferencing
Systems</h1>

May 19, 1998

<p>Dear</p>

<p>Enclosed is a request for a quotation on videoconferencing
equipment. As you can see, Kenyon College and Denison University
are planning to purchase nearly identical systems for our two
campuses. Our time line is to have the systems operational by
September 1, 1998.</p>

<p>We would like a quotation from you by June 15, 1998. Since a
demonstration will be necessary for members from both schools,
would you be available to do this between June 1 and June 15?
Provided you are chosen as our vendor and given our timeline, are
you prepared to provide the equipment and support needed to make
our systems operational by September 1?</p>

<p>We look forward to receiving your quotation on or before June
15, 1998. If you should have any questions, please contact me at
740-587-6719 or e-mail me at frazier@cc.denison.edu.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Michael O. Frazier<br>
Director of Auxiliary and Risk Management Services</p>

Introduction

<p>Denison University and Kenyon College will purchase two sets of
new videoconferencing equipment. The two colleges plan to use this
technology to enhance collaborative teaching, and to facilitate
administrative meetings and resource sharing. We seek to install
industry-standard systems which have potential to be upgraded and
keep pace with changes in the industry, as well as provide the
highest quality video and audio transmissions. In addition to
collaborating among two or more fixed, videoconferencing classrooms
at our institutions, and related small colleges, we want to be able
to engage with other types of videoconferencing systems, including
emerging desktop videoconferencing systems. We expect a high level
of performance and compatibility. We want systems that have
easy-to-use interfaces that minimize the skills and training
required for effective use. Users of the systems at our campuses
will include faculty (teaching, interdisciplinary meetings, etc.),
administrators (interinstitutional meetings), board members (to
reduce travel as needed), and students (for academic purposes).
Denison and Kenyon are members of the Five Colleges of Ohio
Consortium, and the Consortium of Liberal Arts Colleges (60
colleges, nationwide). We anticipate that at some future time, many
of these colleges, including the College of Wooster, Ohio Wesleyan
University and Oberlin College may join us in purchasing compatible
videoconferencing systems.</p>

<center>Requirements and Specifications</center>

At each site, we need: 

<ul>
<li>One codec</li>

<li>Three cameras, two voice activated</li>

<li>One visual presenter (document camera)</li>

<li>Three monitors</li>

<li>30 frames per second capability</li>

mbps (T1).</li>

<li>Vendor supplied support and training</li>

<li>Systems that are H.320 and H.323 compliant</li>
</ul>

It is our plan to interview vendors and see demonstrations of

operational by 8/31/98.
