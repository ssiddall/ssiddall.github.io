<h2>Knapp Hall Computer Lab Projects</h2>

<h4>Two computer lab/classrooms for the social sciences, completed in 2000</h4>
</center>

The plan was to: 

<ul>
<li>Return room 106 to a seminar room with seating and tables, and
some renovation (new carpeting, paint, etc),</li>

<li>Create a 22-computer classroom in room 105, with one student
per computer, plus an instructor's computer and desk, networked
printer, and projection, (with other software appropriate for
intended uses),</li>

<li>Create a 6 computer video editing classroom/lab in room 206,
with two to three students per computer, plus an instructor's
computer and desk, networked printer, scanner, and projection (with
other specialized video hardware and software).</li>
</ul>

The <a href="budget.htm">project budget</a> is available.  Keep in mind that this project was completed in 2000.

<h4>More detail on room 206 layout</h4>

The plan for room 206 called for a floor plan (<a href=
"206last.jpg">see image</a>) for six student stations and one
instructor's station (both printer and scanner are now shown on
separate tables). For no other reason than to make sure we've
looked at all the possibilities, I've posted images of the
alternate furniture (<a href="techera0.jpg">front</a>, <a href=
"techera1.jpg">back</a>) that would accommodate six but with more
table space which we need because each student station will have an
LCD computer screen and an NTSC video monitor. The "TechEra" design
provides more table space, and allows one of the monitors to drop
down a bit for easier viewing, and the keyboard to be stowed when
not in use. The plan called for the <a href="clc.jpg">"CLC"
design</a> which doesn't have quite as much table space, but
probably has easier line-of-sight for three students sitting at one
workstation. Comments were solicited through this web site;  the final rooom layout was
needed in order to specify the network connections in the room.

<h4>Room Layouts</h4>

Many designs were possible; these were meant as suggestions from the
design firm (Interactive Learning Systems).

<p>We are considering 48" wide workstation furniture, with side
panels that are 36", 39" or 42" high from the floor. They are
covered with sound-absorbing materials, The 36" height (8" above
the table top) defines spaces for the students but does not
preclude their seeing each other's work. A photo of an older
workstation is <a href="36inch.jpg">available</a> showing the
relative height of the 36" side panel (the computer is on the
tabletop in this image; we're planning on securing the computers
under the table). The 39" and 42" side panels define spaces but
also keep students from seeing each other's work. All side panel
heights allow students to see the instructor, projection screens,
etc.</p>

<p>There are two possible floor plans for room 105. <a href=
"105a.jpg">Plan A</a> has 22 computers as drawn but one would be
eliminated to accommodate the door into 106. <a href="105b.jpg">
Plan B</a> has 22 computers and can accommodate the doorway as is.
A <a href="105.html">side-by-side comparison</a> of the two layouts
is also available.</p>

<p>There were six possible layouts for room 206. Other
designs were possible but not considered.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="206a.jpg">Plan A</a> with six computers for students,
with collaborative seating for 18, one instructor's computer and a
printer</li>

<li><a href="206b.jpg">Plan B</a> with six computers for students,
with collaborative seating for 16, one instructor's computer and a
printer</li>

<li><a href="206b.jpg">Plan C</a> with seven computers,
collaborative seating for 17, one instructor's computer and a
printer</li>

<li><a href="206d.jpg">Plan D</a> with eight computers,
collaborative seating for 18, one instructor's computer, a printer
and desktop for a scanner or other device</li>

<li><a href="206e.jpg">Plan E</a> with eight computers,
collaborative seating (two per computer only) for 16 students, one
instructor'c computer and a printer</li>

<li><a href="206f.jpg">Plan F</a> with six computers on TechEra
consoles (larger, with shelving for equipment arranged in the
middle), drawn with seating for only six but capable of seating 18
(3 per station), one instructor's computer and a printer</li>

<li><a href="206f1.jpg"><strong>NEW</strong> Plan F-1</a> with
seven TechEra consoles capable of seating 21, plus a TechEra
instructors' station and a printer.</li>
</ul>

A <a href="206.html">side-by-side comparison</a> of all six layouts
is also available.
