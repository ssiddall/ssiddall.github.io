<p>This Three Year Plan for Information Technology is a working
document, always in transition, always in need of revision. It is
important to note, however, that strategic plans do not succeed
unless they are built upon a strategic vision shared by the
stakeholders. Kenyon College's strategic vision for information
resources is not articulated in this document; indeed, it may
never have been drafted, discussed and recorded. The newly-formed
<em><strong><a href="../irc.html">Information Resources Council</a></strong></em> has on
its agenda the task of helping the campus develop this shared
vision. <br wp="br1">
