<p>We have drawn together two sources of valuable information to
guide this response. We have combined the major goals and key
issues developed by the campus-wide &quot;Future of Information
Technology Committee&quot; (1994-95) with college accreditation
standards developed by three national technology organizations:
<a href="http://cause-www.colorado.edu">CAUSE</a>, 
<a href="http://www.educom.edu">EDUCOM</a> and <a href="http://arl.cni.org">ARL</a>. 
This plan, always a working document, has
been developed with considerable input from the campus community,
but it needs much more, on a continuing basis. Strategic plans themselves 
have little value without an on-going strategic planning process.  By combining the 
detailed internal review done in 1994-95 with carefully selected national
perspectives, this plan becomes the most comprehensive review of
Kenyon's technology needs to date. For clarity, the matrix is
broken down into ten areas: </p>

<p>Details, including current status and statements of critical
needs, are presented in the attached report which includes a
capital budget plan. The planning horizon for meeting many
critical, technology needs of the College is three years. The
planning horizon to meet long range goals is further out. <br

</p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>The goal:</strong></font> <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>The goal of this plan is to make the best possible uses of
information technology in supporting the College's needs for the
next three to five years while containing operating costs.
Elements of the plan address specific needs for support services,
for technology that appropriately enhances teaching and learning,
for technology that the best students, our ultimate clients,
require in selecting an institution, for efficient administrative
systems that provide competitive services while containing costs,
and for applications and information access that enhance office
productivity. These are challenging goals; a <em>status quo</em>
will lead to increased costs and inefficiencies that will put
Kenyon at a clear competitive disadvantage. <br wp="br1">
