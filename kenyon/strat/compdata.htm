<h2 align="center"><strong>Comparative data with other institutions in the Consortium of Liberal Arts Colleges</strong></h2>

<p><em><strong>This data should be interpreted with caution</strong></em>
because of variances in the way colleges report the data. Not all
budgets and organizational structures are comparable. Please
visit the <a href="http://liberalarts.org/">Consortium web site</a> for a
list of the colleges in the Consortium (CLAC). <br wp="br1">

</p>

<p>Kenyon's annual investment in information technology is
$1,334,619, slightly below the Consortium mean investment of
$1,358,000. Kenyon's budgeted expenditures on information
technology represents 2.93% of the College's educational and
general budget (1996-97 budget year). This is slightly above the
Consortium average of 2.76% of E &amp; G. The range among the
CLAC schools is 1.3% to 6.6%. Note that percentage of E &amp; G
is an incomplete measure of an institution's total investment in
information resources. Expressed as dollars invested per student
per year, Kenyon is at $814, above the Consortium mean of $763
(most current data is from 1994). <br wp="br1">

<p>Personal ownership of computers by Kenyon students at 88-92%
is among the top 10% of Consortium institutions (April, 1996
data). <br wp="br1">
