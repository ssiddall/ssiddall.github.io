<p class=MsoNormal>Every project begins with someone saying “Could you do
this?” and making it sound so easy that you say “yes.” I was given 5 months
warning. The project seemed simple enough: set up an open source courseware
project from Stanford. So I accepted. I immediately recruited the assistance of
our Oracle DBA, Doug Davenport. Then I promptly forgot about it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In October I was again warned the project was coming up.
This time I was given the choice of going to Stanford for training on the
project before installing it. I accepted. At Stanford, the project was laid out
in detail in two tracks: a technical track and a user/administrator track. I
sat in on the technical track. Later I would feel that it would have been good
to get both tracks. What I did see was perfectly clear. The developers took us
through the installation steps and did not appear to be glossing over anything.
The developers did not actually have the code ready for us to take yet but I
felt ready to run with it. A week later I had the tarball.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I quickly realized as I worked through the steps alone that
I did not know all I needed to install and run a Tomcat/Apache instance. The Tomcat
web site is full of information but very little clear instruction. The product
is distributed in binary code form and source code form. I settled for the
binary code as I wanted to get the project running quickly. In my search for
clear instructions I found <i>More Servlets and Java Server Pages</i> by Marty
Hall. It contains step-by-step guides for getting Tomcat installed and running.
It had good explanations of what the common errors are. Within three weeks of
leaving Stanford I had Stanford’s CourseWork project running. The Oracle
database was built and connecting properly thanks to the efforts of the DBA.
Scott was already asking if a single site could host more than one school’s
courses on it. Stanford had set up a mailing list for the project so this and
any other question that came up went there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Scott indicated that he thought three weeks was excessive
for getting the project running. Considering that I had no hands on experience
with Tomcat prior and no Java programming I felt that we had gotten through it
rather easily. During the time I had gotten the project running, John Norman in
the U.K. had modified it to work with Java 1.4, Tomcat version 4, using
Postgres as its database and provided the developers with a patch for their
code.  Clearly the people with additional experience and skills were further
ahead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, Denison now had <i>Stanford’s</i> CourseWork product
running on our campus. We needed to make it <i>Denison</i><i>’s</i> CourseWork
product. Changes had to be made to the Oracle tables to populate them with the
name of departments at Denison. Stanford uses quarters and Denison uses
semesters so more changes were required. These changes were done by editing the
original scripts that built the Oracle tables and rebuilding. Scott had me give
the Stanford graphics to his staff to change them into Denison graphics. I then
needed to go through all the template files and make the links to documentation
and email addresses point to Denison University sites. About this time Stanford
provided us with a new tarball with the latest code changes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With vacations and holidays the Denison version of CourseWork
was not online until January 22. Scott created the first course and thought it
was slick. A week later when he started creating user accounts we realized
something was wrong. Users were supposed to get an email message indicating
their new account and password. Users were not getting these emails. Daisy
Flemming, CourseWork developer at Stanford, realized they had used Stanford’s
email server in the code. She told us what to change. We did this, removed all
the accounts and recreated them. The users received their emails with their
passwords.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two weeks later and we started seeing error messages when
assignment were created. This was tracked down to expectations of being able to
write into certain directories that did not yet exist.  March 9<sup>th</sup>,
2003 I am still being told about pages which need to have their headers and
footers corrected to eliminate Stanford links in favor of Denison ones. A few
weeks later the first of three students forgets his CourseWork password. I
found the passwords in cleartext in one of the Oracle tables and was able to
tell the student.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, we were successful in getting CourseWork fixed and
running. Questions were answered by the developers and changes provided via
their mailing list. It is wonderful to be able to discuss and make changes as
needed. Getting some training in Java or having someone else with Java training
available would be helpful. If we choose to continue using CourseWork we will
need to consider multiple front-end systems to provide adequate performance.
Stanford uses 4 Sun Netra T1 systems. Denison would likely find three Sun
LX50’s sufficient for the whole campus. The pilot was carried out on a Sun
Netra X1 for the frontend and a Sun E450 for the Oracle database.</p>
