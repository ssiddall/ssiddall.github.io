McKee died in 1848 and is buried about four miles from the home. The main part of the house was built by Joseph Workman between 1831 and 1835. Joseph's daughter, Mary Jane, married one Squire J. Butler, and for him and his heirs, this home is known as the Butler Farm. The original 100 acres has been pared down to 12 now...open fields, hardwood forests, a pond...where we've observed <a href="birds.htm">56 species of birds</a> to date. Deer, racoon, rabbits, squirrels, muskrats, mink and wild turkeys are all around.  Nearly all of our neighbors are Amish...the Keims, Millers, Yoders, Weavers.</strong></p><a href="personal.html">Back to Family & Fun</a></font><hr><font face="arial, verdana, helvetica"><font size="-1">Note:Background sounds are "peepers" taped from our back yard during athunderstorm in April, 2000 (an embedded mp3 file; Copyright 2001-2011, Scott E.
