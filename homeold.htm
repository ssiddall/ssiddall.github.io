<p><font face="arial, verdana, helvetica"><strong>We've traced the
history of our home back to an original land grant from James
Madison in 1816 to one Aner Adee, a private in the Connecticut
militia, who appears to have died before he could take possession
of the 100 acres granted him. The land was given then directly to
Charles McKee, who died in 1848 and is buried about 4 miles from
the home. The main part of the house was built by Joseph C. Workman
between 1831 and 1835. Joseph's daughter, Mary Jane, married one
Squire J. Butler, and for him and his heirs, this home is known as
the Butler Farm. The original 100 acres has been pared down to 12
now...open fields, hardwood forests, a pond...where we've observed
<a href="birds.htm">51 species of birds</a> to date. Deer, racoon,
rabbits, squirrels, muskrats, mink and wild turkeys are all around.
Nearly all of our neighbors are Amish...the Keims, Millers, Yoders,
Weavers.</strong></p>
