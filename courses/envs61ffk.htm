Subj:	Swordfish gillnet closure, adaptive management

Greetings!  As a former temporary employee of NMFS Highly Migratory
Species Division who spent 10 days at-sea with the swordfish drift gillnet
fleet in 1994, I am very disturbed with the latest press release.  I
respect both the NMFS HMS staff and the fishers involved, yet feel that
something is awry that needs to be addressed.

The first distress relates to the allegedly high numbers of turtles and
marine mammals taken.  This should not happen.

Secondly, no mention is made of other non-swordfish catch, especially
sharks. My experience indicated a large take of sharks.  Mammals and
turtles are glitzy, but there are other critters in the ecosystem that
when &quot;taken&quot; should be able to close or alter a fishery as well.

Thirdly, if the the fishery is that &quot;sloppy&quot; with respect to mortalities
of protected species something must be done.

Fourthly, unless a more research orientation is applied to existing
fisheries (oh no, not adaptive management!!) these stories will continue
and more folks will issue a call for something to be done. Some folks will
call for closure of the fishery, others will want to change the Marine
Mammal Protection Act.  There will be a great debate regarding what to do.

The bottom line is that unless the fishery is set up so that learning can
occur, the &quot;answer&quot; will evade us.  Without such knowledge, the only
course is to close a fishery.  That solution may not be the &quot;best&quot;
solution, but there may be no data to provide one.  Then, there may be
data but they may provide little meaning.

Taking an applied research focus would help.  The shrimp trawl fishery is
an obvious example of applied research yielding a work in progress
solution to non-shrimp mortality and interaction.

Trying to go back and review the data to determine why mammal mortalities
were unusually high is just the first step that will probably not tell a
lot.  The next step is to try to generate some hypotheses (weather,
temperature, currents, tow time, tow depth, fish distribution, forage
distribution, etc).

I'm sure both NMFS and the fishers involved have some ideas of what went
wrong and what might work better.  Can a meeting/work session be arranged
for this?  Then guidelines can be generated for a subsequent fishery to
test these hypotheses.

With such a small fleet (<14 boats?) and complete observer coverage, collecting data may not be a big
issue. However, with such a small fleet and limited tows (~100 according to the press
release) the academic types will be concerned with a small sample size being unable to
show anything given the wild swings in fishing styles, gear and ocean conditions. Yes, but
can't we figure out something? It is bad enough that high mortalities occurred and a
fishery was closed before it reached it's "quota". It's even worse to be unable to offer
an explanation that can help prevent future mortalities of marine species and prevent
unwelcome disruption to fishing fleets. It may well be that this fishery is not compatible
with marine mammals and turtles. If so then the fishery should be closed. The same thing
has beens said with with tuna-dolphin in the Pacific and shrimp-turtles in the Gulf of
Mexico. Those situations have improved and there is more work to be done. Why can't we
fish and learn at the same time?? Apologies for length. Geoffrey Habron, Graduate Student

someone please provide evidence for the rather casually made assertion that "swordfish
stocks are declining faster than any other marine species"? I must admit that this is news
to me (does this apply to swordfish stocks across the world???), particularly if in fact
the entire universe of marine species across the world is being used as a point of
reference. Because this message/article has been produced by various
individuals/organizations, the source of this statement is unclear, though it appears
attributable to North Carolina's Swordfish Education and Awareness (a program/group with
which I am unfamiliar). Does anyone have any insights? Let me further add that I find the
implicit analogy between the history of the buffalo (bison???) and swordfish to be highly
questionable and misleading. Michael D. Travis, Ph.D. Industry Economist NMFS/SERO

*************************************************************************** MARINE MAMMAL
KILLS STOP SWORDFISH DRIFTNETTERS WASHINGTON, DC, August 31, 1998 (ENS) High marine animal
deaths in driftnets has prompted the National Marine Fisheries Service not to reopen the
1998 Atlantic Swordfish driftnet fishery in the deep ocean waters off North America. Large
numbers of sea turtles, dolphins and whales have been caught during the 14 days that
driftnet boats were allowed out this year. The kill rate of whales and dolphins in this
fishery is about twice the rate recorded in previous driftnet seasons. "There is an
alarmingly high number of marine mammal kills in this fishery," Fisheries Service Director
Rolland Schmitten said. "Preliminary observer data indicate that there were 293 marine
mammals taken in 109 hauls, including 253 common dolphins and 11 beaked whales. This is
nearly three marine mammals killed per haul." Fisheries Service managers had predicted
that the ten vessels from Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Florida that primarily fish the
south side of Georges Bank for swordfish would catch their 41.6 metric ton quota within
the 14 day period. The fishermen managed to catch about two-thirds of the quota within
that time. But fishermen also snared 34 endangered or threatened sea turtles, including
two Green, five Leatherback and 27 Loggerhead turtles along with the 293 whales, dolphins
and other marine mammals caught in the driftnets. Sea turtles and some marine mammal
species are protected under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). All marine mammals are
protected under the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act. "Two Green sea turtles have
already been taken in this fishery," said Schmitten. "It's very likely any reopening of
this fishery would result in additional sea turtle deaths." An Incidental Take Statement
in the Biological Opinion for this fishery authorized, in accordance with Section 7 of the
ESA, a maximum take [kill or injury] of two Green sea turtles. The Marine Mammal
Protection Act requires the Fisheries Service to calculate the Potential Biological
Removal (PBR) level for each marine mammal species that may be killed or seriously injured
during fishing operations. A primary goal of the Marine Mammal Protection Act is to ensure
that the level of marine mammals seriously injured or killed by commercial fishing
activities is reduced to below the PBR level to ensure species survival. In the case of
common dolphins, the PBR for all fisheries is 155 animals, well below the 253 dolphins
killed in swordfishers' driftnets as recorded by observers. The PBR of nine for beaked
whales was also exceeded, as 11 beaked whales were drowned in the driftnets. Fishery
managers, the conservation community, and domestic fishermen are all concerned about
imports of undersized fish and quota compliance. TAKING SWORDFISH OFF THE MENU Fine
seafood restaurants pride themselves on their special recipes for this fish that has been
called the filet mignon of the sea. But conservation groups are conducting campaigns to
reduce consumer demand for swordfish. Under the slogan "Give Swordfish a Break," the
Natural Resources Defense Council and Seaweb, a project of the Pew Charitable Trust, have
been recruiting chefs nationwide to take swordfish off their menus. About 100 chefs have
done so, but many more have continued to create and serve popular swordfish dishes.
Washington, DC restauranteur Nora Pouillon said, "Neither of my two restaurants, Nora or
Asia Nora, have served swordfish in the past five years. My fish purveyor was starting to
offer me smaller and smaller swordfish from the North Atlantic and it was then that I
realized that we had already overfished the adult swordfish and now we were consuming the
teenagers." Carl Safina, director of the National Audubon Society's Living Oceans Program
has said, "The last buffalo hunt is occuring in the ocean. Poorly regulated exploitation
of some of the most magnificent animals on earth, including swordfish, is emptying the
seas." Swordfish stocks are declining faster than any other marine species, according to
North Carolina's Swordfish Education and Awareness. The recreational swordfish fishery is
nearly non-existent today due to extreme overfishing and wasteful fishing practices by
commercial longline and drift gill net vessels, the group maintains. The United States is
a primary importer of swordfish, importing about 15,600 metric tonnes in 1997 from
international fishers. Swordfish are highly migratory fish and are harvested worldwide
from tropical, subtropical and temperate seas. While Atlantic swordfish are not an
endangered species, the most recent scientific information, from 1996, indicates that the
North Atlantic swordfish stock is overfished, and preliminary analysis shows that current
levels of harvest in the South Atlantic are not sustainable. Swordfish can live to be more
than 25 years old and grow to a weight of 1,200 pounds. They have no scales or teeth, but
have a long swordlike bill used to slash at prey. Full Text and Graphics:

SWORDFISH In response to Mr. Mike Travis' "challenge" against the North Carolina Swordfish
Education Awareness' claim that "swordfish stocks are declining faster than any other

focus point which allows them to view the precarious situation we have caused our marine
fisheries stocks to be in. The swordfish is a perfect poster fish fch a campaign. Whether
caught on long lines or in drift nets, the swordfish is virtually synonymous with bycatch.
Like the tuna ban in 90-91? this too could raise the public's awareness. Once again we've
got to save flipper. Perhaps that's why there was no mention of fish bycatch. They're only
fish right, not as glamorous as endangered seaturtles and marine mammals. As far as the
analogy between swordfish and the buffalo, I doubt a better one could be drawn up. Look at
the plight of the buffalo. The American Indians had a sustainable resource in the herds
that roamed the plains. However, the white man (driftnetter, longline, trawlers etc.)
viewed the buffalo as an infinite resource. They were killed for hide or sport(bycatch),
in a thoughtless, completely wasteful slaughter. The plains(oceans) that they once
prospered on are now checkered by farms and ranches just as the world's coastlines will
soon be spotted with aquaculture facilities. Technology has turned the hunter/gatherer
into a consumer/consumer. We have the power to shape the world's ecosystems in any way we
choose. For instance, in the American west, here non-native species (plants or animals)
are cultivated where native species once prospered. Now the native species (those still
found in the area) have retreated to the relative safety of the mountains where they are
regulated like just another commodity and even killed for fear of infecting livestock. Is
this the future we have in mind for the underwater world? Audobon had an article earlier
this year regarding this subject if Mr. Travis would like some literature to refer to from
a more well known source. Let's stop all the finger pointing and focus that energy on a

didn't succeed in convincing all animals that the sky was falling. Yelling

....And its a good thing too. A steady diet of buffalo burgers without veggies

Guy,

With all due respect, what planet are you from?? The tuna/dolphin example
proved beyond a shadow of a doubt how disastrous the results of managing
fisheries via popular opinion and public hysteria can be! While there was not
a &quot;tuna ban&quot;, the 1990-91 campaign resulted in US labeling laws which banned
tuna caught using the dolphin encirclement purse seine method in the Eastern
Tropical Pacific from being sold on the US market.  It sounded like a cool solution
to armchair resource managers from Hollywood, millions of brainwashed school
kids, animal rights extremists and some very confused legislators.  However, it
was lousy, shortsighted, ignorant resource management.

Bycatch of other non-targeted species shot through the roof as a direct result of
this horrid populist &quot;solution.&quot;   Dr. Martin Hall of the IATTC later found that for
every dolphin &quot;saved&quot;, 15,620 juvenile tuna, 428 triggerfish, 382 mahi-mahi, 190 wahoo,
7.6 rainbow runners, 800 other small fish, 11 blacktip sharks, 4 silky sharks, 2.4
whitetip sharks, .4 hammerhead sharks, 2.9 other sharks and rays, not to mention
endangered sea turtles and various other species. You had mentioned &quot;...virtually
synonymous with bycatch...&quot; and boy, those are the exact words that pop into my
mind when I think of the misguided 1990 dolphin safe campaigning nightmare.

Meanwhile, the dolphin bycatch problem in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) dolphin
associated tuna fishery had been basically solved.  By using Medina panels, backdown
procedures, human escorts to guide dolphins out of fishing nets and various mandates,
guidelines, requirements and government monitoring programs, the dolphin bycatch
problem had fallen from possibly tens of thousands per year in the 1950s to less than
3,000 as of last year.  This number is well below what the MMPA (the strictest
marine mammal protection laws in the world) would allow for.  This level of accidental
does not harm the ETP dolphin populations -- it is biologically insignificant. This program
is the most responsible solution, and that's why Greenpeace, the Center for Marine
Conservation, World Wildlife Fund, the US government and many, many others
backed last year's efforts to undo the damage caused in 1990 by re-defining the US
&quot;dolphin safe&quot; label definition to allow for responsible, strictly controlled dolphin-associated
tuna fishing once again.  By the way, only tuna caught WITHOUT ANY dolphin bycatch
qualifies as dolphin safe under the new definition.  Before, the Hollywood / schoolkids /
popular opinion approach simply disallowed dolphin encirclement (which didn't necessarily
mean dolphins had not been killed during fishing operations) while dramatically increasing
other bycatch.

It was flat irresponsible, but that's what happens when fisheries are managed via public
opinion rather than science and professional fisheries managers.  To encourage the public
to &quot;manage&quot; swordfish through boycotts and hysteria is to simply repeat the same kind
of myopic Flipper-based madness that resulted in such huge problems for the tuna fisheries.
No, fisheries management isn't an exact, perfect science yet, but it's a whole lot more
responsible than the alternative! We must identify and fix specific problems rather than
creating new ones, and that's my opinion this Wednesday afternoon.

Tana McHale,
I was one of the brainwashed kids you referred to.  Thank you for the
information  provided in your retort.  Is it a bad thing that the public
reacts to bycatch reports so passionately?  If the resource managers had
been on the ball to begin with there probably wouldn't have been a
public outcry.  Correct me if I'm wrong but I doubt the public devised
the dolphin  BRD that so drastically effected other non-targeted
species.
By the way you aren't having swordfish for dinner are you?

There are several problems with this approach:  you antagonize (and
penalize) the very people who you should most be working with to solve
problems - fishermen &amp; processors; you don't get to the root of the
problem - excessive catch by European fleets; and you direct the
attention away from other problems that may exist.

And incidentally, the swordfish issue has nothing to due with bycatch -
it is a question of maintaining proper harvest levels.

Tana McHale dealt at length with the tuna/dolphin issue, so I won't add
any more.  As for buffalo, let's not forget the ancient practice of
lighting prairie fires to drive herds over cliffs (an efficient but
significantly wasteful technique) that was in use long before my
ancestors made it to North America.  Also keep in mind that the hunting
of buffalo was completely unregulated - a situation that does not exist
with swordfish or any other species harvested in the U.S. and Canada.
And shall we keep habitat in mind when discussing terrestrial species?
How many ski resorts are there in Steamboat Springs?

&gt; Let's stop all the finger pointing and focus that energy on a
&gt; sustainable solution.


I agree; but it wasn't the fishermen and processors who have fought hard
for biologically justified reduced harvest levels on swordfish that
called for a ban on eating them.

And I did enjoy the swordfish fillet I had Friday night.

Ms. McHales' heated response to Mike Travis's analysis of swordfish issues
has some factual elements, i.e. setting on logs and other objects to snare
tuna does result in an increased bycatch of others species.  Of course, we
could engage in a protracted discussion of the worth of individual species
and engage in some kind of a balancing process, but she's correct that the
actions of fishers to reduce dolphin bycatch have ultimately obviated the
need to do so.

What floors me, however, is the fact that she appears to think that these
changes in conduct by the industry occurred in a vacuum.  But for the
actions of those environmental groups she inveighed against the industry
(and governments) would probably have blithely continued the carnage.  One
only needs to look at the effectiveness of the use of Packwood-Magnuson and
Pelly, as well as the use of  embargoes under CITES to realize the vital
role of the threat of boycotts and trade embargoes play when other methods
prove unavailing.  To imply that the tuna industry would have taken these
measures on its own volition absent public pressure is laughable.  To imply
that government acted in this context without public pressure engendered by
the work of environmental groups is also clearly fallacious.

&gt;Tana McHale,
&gt;I was one of the brainwashed kids you referred to.  Thank you for the
&gt;information  provided in your retort.  Is it a bad thing that the public
&gt;reacts to bycatch reports so passionately?

Public involvement can and has been a very positive thing in some situations.
In other situations their passionate reactions led to runaway hysteria that
resulted bad yet &quot;politically correct&quot; decisions rather than the systematic
development of objective, scientifically sound, targeted solutions to specific
problems. It really depends on what information they are reacting to, and
what options the public has for responding or participating in a given
process.

&gt;...If the resource managers had
&gt;been on the ball to begin with there probably wouldn't have been a
&gt;public outcry.  Correct me if I'm wrong but I doubt the public devised
&gt;the dolphin  BRD that so drastically effected other non-targeted
&gt;species.

I'm somewhat at a loss here... there isn't any magic dolphin BRD, although
there is an effective dolphin conservation program that uses a combination
of gear modifications, fishing techniques, release procedures, quotas, data
reporting protocols, observers, and a mandatory training requirement for
fishermen in the ETP dolphin associated tuna fishery.  It is true that the
public did not devise this program (governments, resource managers,
scientists, and fishery participants did) although as a direct result of public
outcry, all tuna harvested under this program were embargoed by the US.
This is what encouraged fishing on logs and FADs, which increased
bycatch of so many other species. Of course the public didn't directly
advocate an increase in bycatch, yet this was the ultimate result of their
feel-good yet misguided intentions.

&gt;By the way you aren't having swordfish for dinner are you?

Ummmm, since you asked... delicious swordfish with a lemon-caper
sauce, lightly glazed Brussels sprouts, garlic mashed potatoes, sprigs of
fresh parsley, some Chardonnay... sounds wonderful, doesn't it? Yet
unfortunately I've already eaten a grilled ham and cheese sandwich.
Rather shameful, to think of the animals (possibly including endangered
subspecies) that died while getting chopped up in the combines used to
harvest grain for my bread. Then pigs (ham for my sandwich!) generate
waste that can contaminate waterways, even encourage Pfisteria, and
then Willie Nilson gets very upset over factory farms.  Then there's the
cheese made with milk, which the People for Ethical Treatment of Animals
says one shouldn't consume since doing so supports cruelty to cows. And
don't cows emit methane gas which leads to global warming? As a matter
of fact, I can't think of anything to eat that doesn't tread on one campaign
or another...

At any rate, there are very serious problems in the world that must be
addressed, yet I am not yet convinced that boycotts and the-sky-is-falling
campaigns offer the best solutions. I can't resolve pig waste problems,
control greenhouse gas emissions, or assess the physiological condition
of dairy cows -- these are not my areas of expertise, and I wouldn't be able
to judge the best solution out of a list of complex options in many situations.
This is why I feel it's often necessary to depend on experts in other fields to
wade through special interest agendas and decide how to best conserve
and manage resources (usually involving multiple, relevant, complex, situation-
specific issues) on my behalf. However, I have some knowledge of fishery
management trends and issues, and sometimes I can help fishermen and
policy makers investigate various options for identifying and addressing
fishery problems.  Maybe I'm old fashioned, yet I really feel more comfortable
sticking with what I know (or have adequate time to thoroughly study) rather
than leaping onto every a shiny bandwagon that passes by.

&gt;Have a nice evening,

You too, Guy.

You apparently didn't understand my first message as addressed to Guy at

Guy brought up the tuna/dolphin issue, which in my view is an excellent

That said, I hope you received a copy of Rod Moore's response to Guy, and

Subj:	Re: FW: SWORDFISH, Tuna/Dolphin, Bycatch, and Unfair Pacts

Lacking extensive experience with swordfish and the tuna/dolphin fishery
and situation, I will not engage in an extensive discussion about the
problems associated with swordfish stocks and bycatch levels of dolphin and
various finfish species caught with tuna.  I do, however, have some
questions about policies and potential regulatory strategies.

First, what happened to the ETP tuna fleet with the dolphin-safe policy?
How many vessels continued fishing the ETP.  Second, what happened (or
usually happens) to technical and economic efficiency when bycatch
reduction programs were (are) implemented?  Third, why shouldn't the public
be concerned about levels, and more importantly, be involved in fisheries
management and regulation?  The resources are owned by the public and
usually managed for the benefit of the public?  The public has every right
to voice their opinion and resource managers must consider such opinions.

There are major problems with many bycatch proposals.  An examination of
the three basic methods for catching tuna in the ETP fishery indicates that
fishing on dolphins was the most technically efficient.  Obviously, a
rigorous quantitative analysis was not necessary since the majority of the
fleet was regularly fishing on dolphins--dolphin fishing was obviously the
most efficient method.  Log and school sets are less efficient ways to
catch yellowfin tuna.  Nevertheless, the dolphin-safe policy was adopted as
were numerous other procedures for minimizing the capture or killing of
dolphins.

Issues which must be considered in reducing bycatch include technical and
economic efficiency, benefits to society, flexibility of fleet, and the
capture of prohibited species and undersized species.  Of course, useful
definitions of bycatch are also necessary (e.g., is submerged aquatic
vegetation a bycatch?).  In the case of the tuna fishery, what options were
available to the vessels to reduce the capture of dolphins?  What options
would allow technical and economic efficiency to remain relatively
unchanged while also reducing the capture of dolphin?  It may be that there
were no options?

Back to swordfish and bycatch:  There should be little doubt that swordfish
are overexploited.  All available information indicates that there are some
resource problems.  While boycotting swordfish may not be the best
solution, it is one solution that affects the exploitation and sale of
swordfish.  What is needed, however, is first a full-blown assessment of
the resource.  What is the current size?  What is the allowable harvest?
What is the age class structure?  What is the reproductive pattern?  What
is the reproductive pattern relative to commercial and recreational
harvesting activities?  What gear types and/or configurations minimize
bycatch of marine mammals, turtles, other species, and juveniles or
age/size classes necessary to improve the resource?  What are (or should
be) the goals and objectives of managing the resource?  Last, would a
full-blown closure or moratorium on harvesting be an adequate precautionary
approach to avoid additional resource problems until an assessment was
completed and appropriate regulatory policies were designed?

On to one last issue &quot;UNFAIR PACTS LET RICH PILLAGE WORLD'S
OCEANS&quot; - WWF

Much of what is contained appears to be important &quot;food for thought.&quot;  A
lot of statements (I guess facts) are offered indicating various problems
around the world.  The amount paid by European fleets to catch tuna and the
associated statements really impressed me.  &quot;What should be an appropriate
amount to pay for access by foreign vessels?&quot;  Four percent, to me, seems
to be quite high.  What is the cost of monitoring and managing the fishery
and assessing the resource?  How have foreign nations benefitted from
allowing foreign vessels access to their resources and should these
benefits be considered as partial payment for resource access?  How does
the local population and local and national government feel about allowing
foreign access?  I am aware of some American vessels operating out of two
South American nations and the structure of the access agreement appears to
have been quite beneficial to the local and national economies and to the
American companies.  I do not, however, have any information on the
resource levels.

&gt; As far as the analogy between swordfish and the buffalo, I doubt a

&gt; American Indians had a sustainable resource in the herds that roamed the
&gt; plains.

I always find this analogy of Native Americans living in
harmony with their environment to be quite interesting, and
IMHO a bit naive. It has nothing to do particularly with
culture, but with numbers.  The Native Americans took
(harvested, etc.) as much bison as they needed (market
demand).  However, let's face it; there simply weren't that
many Native Americans (nor technology) to harvest above a
sustainable level.  Additionally, without a nomadic
behavior, I doubt they could have existed in large numbers
in many areas.  I know there are examples where large
&quot;permanent&quot; concentrations of Native Americans existed, and
they degraded their environment to the point (in some cases)
that their civilization simply disappeared. (Before someone
takes offense that I'm bashing Native Americans, I'm simply
trying to point out its human nature - not culture.)

More to the point, I am not condoning the later hunting to
near extinction, but it is a good example of what a little
bit of technology can do for production, and how human
nature (greed - for lack of an alternative, more polite, yet
oversimplified word) will use that technology to excess if
unregulated.

&gt; However, the white man (driftnetter, longline, trawlers etc.)
&gt; viewed the buffalo as an infinite resource.  They were killed for hide
&gt; or sport(bycatch), in a thoughtless, completely wasteful slaughter.

I don't think any fishery views its resource as indefinite,
nor will you win many friends saying that &quot;sport&quot; is
bycatch.  I also do not see the analogy; more to the point,
the actions of the day have a very different connotation
than they will in a historical context.  Almost all now
agree that the buffalo example (or beaver, etc.) was a
'slaughter', but at the time, collecting and using those
furs, hides, etc. were considered to be quite a normal way
of existence.  Hindsight is 20-20.

Perhaps the base problem is still one we hear today: &quot;Oh,
one extra fish (extra 500 pounds) over the bag limit (trip
limit) won't matter.&quot;, or &quot;Oh, its only one beer can out the
car window.&quot;, or &quot;Oh, its only a 100' of seawall where a
marsh used to be.&quot;, or &quot;Its only one mangrove blocking my
waterview.&quot;, etc. etc.  Its a lack of perspective by most
folks (fishers, non-fishers, consumers, non-consumers alike)
as to the cummulative effects.


&gt; The plains(oceans) that they once prospered on are now checkered by farms
&gt; and ranches just as the world's coastlines will soon be spotted with
&gt; aquaculture facilities.


More correctly, the conversion (note I didn't use
'destruction', 'rape', 'pillaging') of the tall and short
grass prairies to farms and ranches (and ski resorts, Rod)
is an analogy I have often used to describe the current
state of our fisheries, fish habitats, and fish stocks.
In a general sense, for both the terrestrial and oceanic
realms, we have erased a quite viable naturally evolved
environment and its fauna/flora to make the world better
suit our purposes: we alter the environment to one that is
conducive to generating the products we desire.  However,
since we all use the land, are more familiar with the
terrestrial situation, and more folks benefit from its
alteration, we are more willing to accept its alteration for
our purposes. By contrast - perhaps since most of us don't
use the oceans, the same connectivity isn't there - there
seems to be a much greater (hypocritical?) perception of a
need to keep the ocean in a &quot;natural&quot; state.

Is this good or bad?  All depends on perspective, I suppose,
and I am not going down that road here, although I suspect
others will.  As someone else said: &quot;Biodiversity is a
wonderful thing, unless its a weed in wheat field.&quot;

I'm not sure why he refers to people who look at their own economic
benefit as &quot;boneheads&quot;. There is lots of incentive to do this, and
putting the long-term welfare of society and the environment ahead of
protecting one's own interests is rare. This is more generally the case
in impoverished areas than in wealthy countries, since people who
survive on a day-to-day basis can seldom afford the luxury of not
fishing to protect stocks, since that is what they live on (even though
it is also true that people who live close to their environment may have
a closer feeling for it). The &quot;short-term economic benefit&quot; is what

Anyway, there are lots of people who qualify as boneheads by this

that the bottom line is that we cannot trust a system of free access
to practice conservation, and that without management and regulation of
the fishery, there is not only a risk, but a probability, that

Oops.  I hit &quot;send&quot;, when I meant to hit &quot;get message&quot;.  Just one of

Actually, the point was that the boneheads are a small group, relative
to the whole, so I'm not sure what the problem is here.  Concern for
one's short-term economic benefit is normal and appropriate.  Caring
about nothing else (which is the extreme to which I refer explicitly) is
neither - and it is generally self-defeating.  Such people exist, and
they are not disproportionately abundant in poor societies, in my
experience.  If you are interpreting my comments to imply that the Chobe
interviewees were boneheads, as seems to be the case, then I must
apologize for not being clear.

&gt; This is more generally the case

The people with whom I worked in Botswana were poor, by North American
standards, but they were neither boneheads, nor unable to see the
importance of long-term
considerations.  As I said in my original message, the response I
received to the questionnaire was related to local circumstances
(including the relatively low-level effort by the local fishing
community, whose fishing was seasonal - the rest of the year they
farmed).  The points I apparently failed to make with sufficient clarity
are: 1)  Some fisheries do view the resource as infinite and 2) within
any fishing community there is a diversity of opinion about the relative
vulnerability of stocks to exploitation.


&gt; Anyway, there are lots of people who qualify as boneheads by this
&gt; definition,

Actually, I think not - which was part of my point to begin with.

&gt; but derogatory language won't change their minds.

I'm a long way from this and ignorant of the facts, so could somebody
elaborate, please?

It sounds as if an important species (buffalo) was devastated by the
corporates (Railroads), and no doubt others, for the sake of their profits
- not primarily for basic food needs and livelihoods and regardless of the
wishes of locals (they were Indians in the movies I saw).

Isn't this similar to the present concern for the oceans: too much
exploitation is driven by profit, especially by large-scale in a way that
threatens species, the food needs and livelihoods of  locals and
small-scale fishers?

Can anyone point me to literature on the benefits (eg cost/benefit
analyses) for the wider community, society, nation, of large-scale
vertically integrated enterprises (such as corporates, transnationals,
large companies etc.) in comparison with small-scale, traditional, local
... (artisanal in developing nations) or owner-operated, local community,
small company ... (in developed nations), ideally in terms of both domestic
and export markets, please?

It's kind of interesting that both the media and now some FISHFOLK'ers are
making comparisons between fish and buffalo when few seem to be sure
about exactly what happened to the buffalo.  They're bison actually, and it
appears obvious to me that one really can't use a bison decline analogy with
references to fish populations at all.  For example:

Fish are broodcast spawners while bison can only have one or two calves at a time;

Bison were not subject to any conservation programs (there were no &quot;bag limits,&quot;
time/area closures, limited entry permit systems, size limits, or broodstock protection
efforts in place for these animals before they were nearly wiped out altogether);

Bison were much easier to track down than fish are (fish don't leave tracks that
one can follow) Also, bison lived in open spaces rather than hiding out in the woods
or mountains. A single bison can be spotted on a plain from a great distance away,
whereas fish cannot be easily seen from even short distances.  Since they cannot
be easily seen and also live in a three dimensional environment, fish have greater
natural refuge opportunities than buffalo do; and

Bison ended up sharing the same relatively limited physical living space with millions of
humans (&amp; hunters), whereas fish are targeted by comparatively small groups of fishermen
-- part-time &quot;visitors&quot; -- in huge areas  (that is, depending on the species... but swordfish
and other highly migratory fish species roam over millions of square miles of oceans
many times larger than the terrestrial areas occupied by buffalo).

Anyway, I'm not exactly an bison expert, so here's an interesting article about what
one bison researcher's views:

BISON EXPERT TO GIVE TALK IN BUFFALO;
SAYS DECLINE OF HERDS NOT ALL HUNTERS' FAULT
By Mike Vogel, News Staff Reporter

Dan Flores lives a long way from Buffalo, but he's coming to the right city.

From his home in the Bitter Root Valley and his office at the University of
Montana, Flores has spent the last several years researching the decline of the
American bison -- or, if you will, the buffalo.

He'll present the results of that research Sunday at -- where else? -- the Buffalo
Museum of Science.

If that all fits together nicely, the revised story of the decline of a symbolic
American creature doesn't.

&quot;It was a lot more complex than the story we've been telling in the history
books,&quot; Flores said this week.

&quot;It's not nearly so simple as 10,000 hunters going West after the Civil War and
wiping them out in a matter of 10 to 15 years,&quot; he explained.

Flores, the A.B. Hammond Professor of Western History at the Montana
university and a former Texas Tech teacher, will outline his complex network of
causes that conspired against the majestic plains creature. His talk on &quot;What
Really Happened to the Buffalo?&quot; will be presented at 3 p.m. Sunday, as the
first of this year's Hayes Lectures.

He's also working on a book with the Yale University Press and is among the
revisionist theorists challenging the standard view of bisons hunted to
near-extinction.

That view still has major proponents. In a slight variation on the
wholesale-hunting theory, for example, naturalist Valerius Geist's new book
-&quot;Buffalo Nation&quot; -- claims the U.S. government used its army to kill millions of
buffalo as part of an all-out war to exterminate Native American tribes.

Geist notes that the number of bison plummeted from 30 million in the early
1800s to fewer than 500 animals at the turn of this century, before rebounding
to more than 250,000 today on ranches and sanctuary ranges throughout the
United States.

Flores has seen estimates of the peak number of bison that range up to 75
million, but he and his colleagues see reality as a much smaller number.

&quot;We don't think the Great Plains, even during the Little Ice Age when rainfall
was higher in the West, was capable of supporting more than somewhere
between 22 (million) and 28 million buffalo,&quot; he said.

&quot;Even during the period from 1865 to 1884, which may have been the final
blow, we only have records of 10 million hides being sent East by the hide
hunters. If there were 30 million buffalo, what happened to the other 20 million
hides?&quot;

Hunting helped polish off the great herds, Flores agrees, but the bison was
suffering long before that.

There was increasing hunting pressure from Native Americans long before the
Civil War. There also were climate changes, competition from other animals,
and outbreaks of diseases.

Things may have turned sour for the king of the plains when the Pueblo tribe
revolted in 1680 and pushed the Spanish out of Mexico for a dozen years. The
Pueblo also captured the Spanish stock herds, and the horses Spaniards had
taken to the New World were traded extensively throughout the West.

&quot;Indian acquisition of horses drew population to the Plains,&quot; Flores noted.
&quot;There are a lot more people hunting buffalo by about 1710, 1720.&quot;

The use of horses increased hunting efficiency on the plains, and enticed groups
living on the fringes of the plains to begin living off the bison.

By the 1820s, too, native peoples were no longer hunting bison only for
subsistence. Even before whites and modern firearms attacked the herds,
natives were being &quot;gradually incorporated into the market economy&quot; and were
trading buffalo robes to the East, Flores noted.

By the 1840s and 1850s, 36 tribes hunted bison.

&quot;In addition to that,&quot; Flores said, &quot;there's the effect of the end of the Little Ice
Age. The 400 years from 1450 to 1850 brought increased rainfall to the West,
ensuring bumper crops of grass on the Plains year after year. All of a sudden,
there were droughts.&quot;

The dry weather and sparse grass of the 1840s couldn't have come at a worse
time for the herds. Not only was hunting increasing, but the hunters' horses
were competing with the bison for the grass -- reducing the carrying capacity of
the region by an estimated 15 percent.

And then there were the settlers moving along the Overland Trail, their wagons
pulled by even more &quot;exotic&quot; grazing animals. For the first time, bison were
exposed to anthrax, tuberculosis and other European bovine diseases.

The majestic bison was hunted nearly to extinction in the 19th century, as
settlers spread westward, Easterners sought buffalo robes for winter sleighing
and buffalo hunters slaughtered entire herds to feed the crews building
railroads across the land. But, Flores argues, the final hunts that all but
exterminated the animal aren't the sole cause of the bison's demise.

At the risk of starting yet another debate, it seems to me that the bison has more
in common with the (now extinct) passenger pigeon than fish.
