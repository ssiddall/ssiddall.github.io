The subject of the class is highly interdisciplinary, and I
encourage each of you to select topics, readings, and assignments
with your own interests in mind. The course has in the past had a
theme of the "tragedy of the commons" with special focus on the
coastal (marine) commons. For most of this course we will focus on
the creation of a web site that presents your thinking about issues
related to the tragedy of the commons. The class will debate and
select a theme for this effort. Please look at the web site that
was created by the class in <a href=
"http://www2.kenyon.edu/projects/dams">1998</a> (and also in <a
href="http://www2.kenyon.edu/projects/envs61/">1996</a> and <a href=
"http://www2.kenyon.edu/projects/envs61/prior/commons.htm">
1995</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">Or from the Kenyon
homepage, click on "Academics" then on "Academic Projects" then
"Large Dams" or "The Tragedy of the Coastal Commons."</font></p>

<p><font face="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">The creation of
substantive written content (case studies, disciplinary
perspectives, etc) is expected in the creation of this web
presentation that we can share with others. There is much latitude
in the selection of a specific theme for the web presentation, and
this will be discussed in our first class meetings. Usually, this
collaborative project is based on the work of four or five teams
whose final work is then linked to that of the other teams. The
final product will be graded by me, but I also allocate "points" to
each team member for them to anonymously assign to their team
members counting for 15-20% of the grade on the web publication. In
this manner, both the product and collaborative process are
graded.</font></p>

<p><font face="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">In the first two
meetings of the class, we will focus on the selection of the theme
for the work. Student "presentations" don't dominate the course.
There is more literature to be gathered and read than we all can
manage, so each of you will be expected to bring new and relevant
information to the course. I may suggest some readings but these
are only starting points. I want you to be able to demonstrate that
you can find and review critically new material. We may have a
session with a reference librarian on the use of reference
materials such as Academic Universe or FirstSearch.</font></p>

<p><font face="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">I hope to have one
or more guest lectures brought into the classroom through the video
conferencing systems.</font></p>
